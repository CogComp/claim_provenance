Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said. Missing passports find their way to human traffickers, he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"About 90 percent of foreigners\\' missing passports are Korean\\'s, and the missing passports are being used mostly for crimes like illegal entry, downgrading the nation\\'s credibility in the international community,\" the official said. The number of crimes committed by Koreans has also been on the increase. Among the crimes are illegal trafficking or forgery of passports, drug production and transportation, smuggling, overstaying visas and drunk driving, the official said. Last year, 1.6 million Koreans travelled to China, up from 1.34 million in 2000, and the number of Korean students in China hit 16,000, more than any other country; Japan trailed with 15,000 students,

condemned by some western countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The OAU observer team in Zimbabwe described the election held on March 9-11 as \"free and fair.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"On the basis of observations made during the voting, verification and counting process on the ground and objective realities, the OAU observer team wishes to state that in general the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair,\" the team\\'s leader Gertrude Mongella said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his congratulation message to his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa calls him a champion of democracy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"I am pleased to send my warm congratulations on the renewed and the deserved presidential mandate the people of Zimbabwe have given you,\" Mkapa said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"It would be a great tragedy for anyone to determine the outcome of an African election in Europe,\" Mkapa said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"It was upon the people of Zimbabwe to decide who should lead them and they have done that loudly and clearly.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The people of Zimbabwe have re-elected you because you have been same (consistent) in defending their inalienable rights to their country\\'s freedom, democratic and sovereign government,\" Mkapa said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe on his reelection, saying his victory and that of his ZANU-PF party was \" testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe hold in you\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Within the 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), a team from the SADC Council of Ministers considered that the vote in Zimbabwe was a \"true reflection\" of the people\\'s will. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The chief SADC parliamentary observer Duke Lefhoko said that \" the results are the affair of the people of Zimbabwe.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The SADC Council of Ministers in a statement appeals to the people of Zimbabwe to accept the results. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The South African government in a statement welcomes the fact that the actual elections and subsequent processes have proceeded without any significant conflict among the participants. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The statement said, according to the Preliminary Report of the South African Observer Mission, Zimbabwe\\'s elections should be considered as legitimate. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Nigerian government, a key player in Africa\\'s reaction to events in Zimbabwe, will announce on Thursday its verdict on the elections, Information Minister Jerry Gana said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, Zimbabwe\\'s presidential election was condemned by some western countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n US Assistant Secretary for African affairs Walter Kansteiner in a statement called Zimbabwe\\'s election flawed, saying that the US would consider further sanctions against Mugabe and his government. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said \"for months the government of Zimbabwe has conducted a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation, designed to achieve an outcome -- power at all costs.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said that Mugabe has \"stolen\" Zimbabwe\\'s vote, an outcome that would have \"enormous implications for the nature of UK-Zimbabwe relationship.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n France\\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau said that Zimbabwe\\'s \"election cannot be considered as substantially free and fair.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Germany\\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman Andreas Michaelis said that \"all information points to the fact it cannot be assumed there were equal chances for the candidates in this election.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Denmark\\'s Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said his government will cut aid to Zimbabwe and likely shut down its embassy in Harare. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He also said the European Union will consider toughening sanctions on the Mugabe regime when foreign ministers meet ahead of the Barcelona summit on Friday and Saturday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Denmark gave Zimbabwe aid worth 9.42 million euros (8.3 million US dollars) in 2001 and made available 2 million euros more in 2002 to complete projects already underway. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Zimbabwe\\'s incumbent President Robert Mugabe has won the country\\'s closest-fought presidential election since independence 22 years ago, the final election results showed Wednesday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to the nationwide election results, Mugabe gained 56.2 percent of the total 2,998,758 valid votes, or 1,685,212 votes, while Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) getting 41.96 percent, or 1,258,401 votes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n About 3.4 million of the 5.6 million registered voters in Zimbabwe were estimated to have voted in the controversial election that ended Monday after a high court extended the voting into a third day. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020331/21.11.01-23492": {"extract": [{"text": "Tang said that the

Even the most radical Israeli hardliners expressed the idea of the transfer more politely than the most senior, elected US bodies, which called on the Palestinians to give up the West Bank and look for what they called another homeland. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Congress\\' resolutions and the statements made by leaders and members of the Congress revealed the US Administration\\'s harbored intentions. Rice\\'s statements came to dot the i\\'s and cross the t\\'s. They served as a crude example of the arrogance of power and attempts to control nations\\' resources, dictate policies, and impose leaders through pressure and coercion. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The flagrant attack, which Condoleezza Rice launched on the Palestinian leadership yesterday, demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth, which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations\\' right to choose their leaders. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Rice attacks the Palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former US presidents. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, she refrains from mentioning the elected Israeli leadership, which moved the Israeli army to occupy Palestinian cities, destroy homes over the heads of their owners, arrest thousands of innocent people, and carry out what many legal and international humanitarian circles described as war crimes or bloody massacres to say the least. A prominent Israeli official, Shim\\'on Peres, said when his army moved into the Janin refugee camp: \"I am afraid that a massacre may have been committed in the Janin camp.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Palestinians did not attack Israeli cities, did not arrest thousands of Israeli citizens, and did not blockade their cities and villages, as was done to the Palestinian people without exception. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Yet, the Palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the Israeli prime minister is praised. The US president described him as a man of peace, thereby prompting the world\\'s ridicule sometimes and denunciation at other times. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n So, why do Rice and the US Administration launch campaigns against, and interfere in the affairs of, the Palestinian leadership? Rice is aware of the fact that President Yasir Arafat remained under siege in his headquarters in Ramallah for five months, imposed on him by the superior Israeli military in violation of all the accords that were signed by former Israeli governments and guaranteed by the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These accords explicitly stipulated that Israeli forces must not enter the Palestinian-controlled areas, which are called Areas A and cover all the Palestinian cities, naturally including Ramallah. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US national security adviser should have called for ending the occupation and dismantling the settlements. She knows for certain that this occupation and the settlements, which the Israeli government refuses to remove, represent the only major obstacle to peace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moreover, the aim of these plans is to make the Palestinians yield to the dictates of the Israeli-US alliance, which seeks a mimic resolution to the Palestinian issue, which will perpetuate the occupation and facilitate the expansion of settlements. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n No one, no matter who it is, has the right to meddle in the Palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the Palestinian people a leadership favored by the US Administration and the Israeli Government and tailored according to their mutual interests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Both Washington and Israel must realize that the Palestinian people are intelligent enough to read between the lines and understand the long-term aims behind Condoleezza Rice\\'s statements. The calls in Washington for democracy, transparency, and corruption-free system are only made to serve US plans, not out of concern about nations\\' interests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, there are two facts that ought to be highlighted. The first is that the current Palestinian leadership represents the Palestinian people\\'s will, political convictions, and national aspirations. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The second fact is that if Washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is, it should pressure the Israeli leadership to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories and stop its repressive practices against the Palestinian people. The United States turns a blind eye to these practices, pretending to forget that they violate human rights and are continuously denounced by the international community. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011127/21.22.54-17837": {"extract": [{"text": "Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents.", "question": "the authenticity of the documents", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}, {"text": "The lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of Collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a Lebanese amnesty law.", "question": "to do this", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}, {"text": "In the meantime, the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against Elie Hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres.", "question": "the militia leader", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "The lawyers expect that the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents' authenticity.", "question": "the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents' authenticity", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}, {"text": "It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that Israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility.", "question": "Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Judging from a few texts that De Standaard was given access to, the documents seem to be related to the Israeli Kahan Commission.", "question": "the documents", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "A ruling is expected by the end of this year or early next year.", "question": "A ruling", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "The lawyers refused to reveal the source of the documents.", "question": "reveal the source of the documents", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}, {"text": "It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that Israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility.", "question": "Israel", "answer": ["w", "Lebanese Phalangist militias"]}, {"text": "It published a report, but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released, because they were deemed damaging to the state's interests.", "question": "they", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that Israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility.", "question": "the Phalange to assume responsibility", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors", "various documents", "the Israeli army"]}, {"text": "On behalf of some Palestinian survivors, lawyers Luc Walleyn and Michael Verhaeghe on 18 June filed a complaint with the Brussels Public Prosecution Office against Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in Beirut.", "question": "Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}, {"text": "According to Belgian and international criminal law, they could be held responsible,\" Verhaeghe said.", "question": "they", "answer": ["w", "Verhaeghe", "Belgian and international criminal law"]}, {"text": "On behalf of some Palestinian survivors, lawyers Luc Walleyn and Michael Verhaeghe on 18 June filed a complaint with the Brussels Public Prosecution Office against Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in Beirut.", "question": "Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}, {"text": "Tomorrow, the Chamber for Indictments will begin the debate on Investigating Judge Collignon's questions on the legitimacy of the case against Sharon.", "question": "the legitimacy of the case against Sharon", "answer": ["w", "Judge Collignon"]}, {"text": "Lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium, said this.", "question": "Sharon", "answer": ["w", "Lawyers for the survivors"]}], "context": "\\t\\nBrussels -

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are to take part in preparatory talks on reviving political dialogue in the vast country next month, an official said Saturday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A representative of the facilitator of the talks, Hacen Ould Lebatt, told a media conference here that 38 civil society delegates, representing seven of the DRC\\'s 11 provinces, had already been designated. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The round of consultations ahead of the start of formal negotiations between the various parties -- dubbed the \"inter-Congolese dialogue\" -- will begin August 20 in the Botswana capital Gaborone, the facilitator of the talks, former Botswana president Ketumile Masire, announced this week. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Masire\\'s team, which has criss-crossed the former Zaire to prepare for the talks, is currently pursuing its mission in the provinces of Bandundu, Bas-Congo, Equateur, and in the capital Kinshasa, Lebatt said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Masire said this week he was determined to \"ensure that people from all corners of the country are allowed to express their views\", adding that he wanted to avoid a \"superficial\" exercise. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The national dialogue is a feature of peace accords signed in 1999 by all warring parties in the former Zaire -- two rebel groups, their backers Rwanda and Uganda, and the Kinshasa government and its allies, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Masire was brought back into the DRC peace process in February this year as facilitator for the inter-Congolese dialogue by President Joseph Kabila. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The young president\\'s father Laurent, assassinated in January, had sidelined Masire after accusing him of being biased in favour of the rebels. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Lebatt told the media conference that deep divergences remained concerning the designation of delegates to represent DRC political parties, and those to represent the parties who signed the Lusaka agreement. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The political

about \"political opposition\", he said. \"One must ask \\'opposition to whom and what?\\'.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Lebatt said the facilitation team expected to draw up a final list of participants by
