Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said. Missing passports find their way to human traffickers, he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"About 90 percent of foreigners\\' missing passports are Korean\\'s, and the missing passports are being used mostly for crimes like illegal entry, downgrading the nation\\'s credibility in the international community,\" the official said.

Among the crimes are illegal trafficking or forgery of passports, drug production and transportation, smuggling, overstaying visas and drunk driving, the official said.

\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n ZIMBABWE is amassing huge quantities of arms and ammunition using two African allies in preparation for next year\\'s crucial presidential election, it has been established. Financial Gazette investigations in the past one-and-a-half months have revealed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Namibia are helping Zimbabwe circumvent an international arms embargo to buy huge quantities of guns and bullets for next year\\'s ballot. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The arms embargo was imposed on Harare last year by Europe and the United States on President Robert Mugabe\\'s government because of its appalling human rights record. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The investigations show that Zimbabwe is importing and massing an assortment of guns at army bases around the country in preparation for the poll, which is expected to be violent. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Most of the guns have been arriving secretly at Suri Suri airbase in Chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The bulk of the weapons have arrived from the DRC in that country\\'s military cargo plane. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The weapons consist of a significant portion of French-made guns, most of which top government sources say will be distributed to war veterans who are central to the ruling ZANU PF party\\'s re-election strategy in the presidential poll. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The sources say Zimbabwe, after the massive depletion of its armoury because of its participation in the three-year-old DRC war, has been finding it extremely difficult to replenish its arms stocks because its traditional and cheaper arms suppliers in Europe are refusing to sell it arms. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This had forced the army to implement some unpalatable measures, including the grounding of most of its entire fleet of Hawk fighter aircraft due to Britain\\'s refusal to sell spare parts. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Virtually all European Union member states have severed ties with Zimbabwe and imposed an arms embargo on the country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Although we can still buy a number of arms from countries like Russia and China, a greater part of our fairly priced weapons, ammunition and spares have been sourced from mainly European countries like Britain, Sweden, France and others over the years. We can no longer buy arms from Europe at the moment because of the problems here,\" said a top Ministry of Defence source. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We have been left with no alternative but to buy some weapons via our allies in the DRC who have access to some of these European weapons that we have preference for.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi declined to comment on the allegations of sanctions busting and the massing of guns at army bases around the country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Just avoid that one for now.

They said they did not know whether this was the case with Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"In Africa, we have military relationships with many countries. We have, for instance, sold arms to many French-speaking countries.

Kenya and Tanzania even \"congratulated\" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about \"good governance\" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on \"sustainable development\" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Fortunately, Europe is no longer \"Africa\\'s policeman.\" But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020423/21.35.03-11178": {"extract": [{"text": "NEW DELHI, April 22 -- INTERNATIONAL call charges have finally started tumbling down, with Bharti Telesonic Ltd -- the long-distance arm of the Bharti group offering tariffs that are up to 40 percent lower than the existing rates.", "question": "INTERNATIONAL call charges", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Unlike the STD [subscriber trunk dialing] services where a further rate cut may not be feasible, in the international services there is scope for more improvement,\" he said.", "question": " a further rate cut", "answer": ["w", "Mr Sunil Mittal, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises"]}, {"text": "The company, he said, also planned to start offering Internet telephony services in the near future and deploy Voice over Internet Protocol to strengthen its ILD presence.", "question": "start offering Internet telephony services in the near future and deploy Voice over Internet Protocol to strengthen its ILD presence", "answer": ["w", "Mr Sunil Mittal, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises", "Bharti Telesonic Ltd"]}, {"text": "\"The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and the other ILD operators, who are yet to begin services, announce their rates.", "question": "The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates", "answer": ["w", "Mr Sunil Mittal, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises"]}], "context": "\\t\\nNEW DELHI, April 22 -- INTERNATIONAL call charges have finally started tumbling down, with Bharti Telesonic Ltd -- the long-distance arm of the Bharti group offering tariffs that are up to 40 percent lower than the existing rates. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Announcing this at a news conference, Mr Sunil Mittal, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises, noted that the tariffs, which would be made available on its ILD [international long distance] services being launched on May 1, would be revised downwards as and when the market demanded it. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and the other ILD operators, who are yet to begin services, announce their rates.

As per the tariff plan announced by Bharti, peak-time call charges to the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] region will be offered at Rs 21.18 per minute as against the present Rs 21.82, while for the rest of the world it will be Rs 24 per minute as against Rs 31.30 to Rs 40 that are applicable now. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For non-peak hours, the call rates for the SAARC regions are being lowered to Rs 18 from Rs 18.95 per minute and for the rest of the world at Rs 21.18 per minute from the current Rs 27.69 to Rs 36. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Mr Mittal noted that although the original plan was to launch the ILD services (IndiaOne) by the middle of this month, the company was still awaiting security clearances and the commissioning certificate from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Interconnect agreements had already been signed with almost all cellular operators. The agreement with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) would also be signed in the next couple of days. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He also said that agreements with as many as nine foreign carriers across the globe had already been signed. They include AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, Teleglobe, Eteselat, Saudi Telecom, British Telecom and SingTel to name a few. These nine carriers account for 90 percent of the traffic coming to India. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Bharti, after requisite clearances, will offer its network to all carriers on a non-discriminatory basis. Carriers will now connect to Bharti\\'s network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer. A total investment of Rs 100 crore is planned for the project, of which Rs 75 crore has already been spent,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n IndiaOne had laid approximately 14,000 km of optical fibre cable covering 90 cities. The company has contracted submarine cable capacity from network i2i, and backed it up with satellite connectivity to build in redundancy. The ILD network is based on IP [Internet Protocol] centric backbone. The multiservices platform comprises TDM [Time Division Multiplexing] switch layer, an ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] and IP layer and intelligent network to offer value-added services, he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The company, he said, also planned to start offering Internet telephony services in the near future and deploy Voice over Internet Protocol to strengthen its ILD presence.
