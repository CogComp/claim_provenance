To this end, Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed.\"", "hypothesis": "They claims achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development", "label": 0, "finished": true}], [{"id": 1799, "premise": "The coup misjudged its strength and Carmona remaining in power could have led to a serious division of the armed forces.
