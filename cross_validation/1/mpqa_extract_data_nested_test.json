Rice to make statements yesterday after what can be described as a oneupmanship of rudeness was inaugurated in Washington last week. The legislative branch took part in this oneupmanship by issuing resolutions showing full allegiance to the radical right wing in Israel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US legislative branch even outbade the Israeli right wing. If Rabbi Kahana were alive, he would have been regarded as a moderate person, compared to the US legislative branch. Even the most radical Israeli hardliners expressed the idea of the transfer more politely than the most senior, elected US bodies, which called on the Palestinians to give up the West Bank and look for what they called another homeland. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Congress\\' resolutions and the statements made by leaders and members of the Congress revealed the US Administration\\'s harbored intentions. Rice\\'s statements came to dot the i\\'s and cross the t\\'s. They served as a crude example of the arrogance of power and attempts to control nations\\' resources, dictate policies, and impose leaders through pressure and coercion. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The flagrant attack, which Condoleezza Rice launched on the Palestinian leadership yesterday, demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth, which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations\\' right to choose their leaders. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Rice attacks the Palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former US presidents. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, she refrains from mentioning the elected Israeli leadership, which moved the Israeli army to occupy Palestinian cities, destroy homes over the heads of their owners, arrest thousands of innocent people, and carry out what many legal and international humanitarian circles described as war crimes or bloody massacres to say the least. A prominent Israeli official, Shim\\'on Peres, said when his army moved into the Janin refugee camp: \"I am afraid that a massacre may have been committed in the Janin camp.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Palestinians did not attack Israeli cities, did not arrest thousands of Israeli citizens, and did not blockade their cities and villages, as was done to the Palestinian people without exception. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Yet, the Palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the Israeli prime minister is praised. The US president described him as a man of peace, thereby prompting the world\\'s ridicule sometimes and denunciation at other times. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n So, why do Rice and the US Administration launch campaigns against, and interfere in the affairs of, the Palestinian leadership? Rice is aware of the fact that President Yasir Arafat remained under siege in his headquarters in Ramallah for five months, imposed on him by the superior Israeli military in violation of all the accords that were signed by former Israeli governments and guaranteed by the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These accords explicitly stipulated that Israeli forces must not enter the Palestinian-controlled areas, which are called Areas A and cover all the Palestinian cities, naturally including Ramallah. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US national security adviser should have called for ending the occupation and dismantling the settlements. She knows for certain that this occupation and the settlements, which the Israeli government refuses to remove, represent the only major obstacle to peace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moreover, the aim of these plans is to make the Palestinians yield to the dictates of the Israeli-US alliance, which seeks a mimic resolution to the Palestinian issue, which will perpetuate the occupation and facilitate the expansion of settlements. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n No one, no matter who it is, has the right to meddle in the Palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the Palestinian people a leadership favored by the US Administration and the Israeli Government and tailored according to their mutual interests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Both Washington and Israel must realize that the Palestinian people are intelligent enough to read between the lines and understand the long-term aims behind Condoleezza Rice\\'s statements. The calls in Washington for democracy, transparency, and corruption-free system are only made to serve US plans, not out of concern about nations\\' interests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, there are two facts that ought to be highlighted. The first is that the current Palestinian leadership represents the Palestinian people\\'s will, political convictions, and national aspirations. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The second fact is that if Washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is, it should pressure the Israeli leadership to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories and stop its repressive practices against the Palestinian people. The United States turns a blind eye to these practices, pretending to forget that they violate human rights and are continuously denounced by the international community. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20010707/05.19.38-789": {"extract": [{"text": "The two countries have each accused the other of backing dissidents.", "question": "dissidents", "answer": ["w", "Uganda", "Rwanda"]}, {"text": "The two countries have each accused the other of backing dissidents.", "question": "the other", "answer": ["w", "Uganda"]}, {"text": "In March, Uganda declared Rwanda a hostile nation because of tensions arising from Kigali's alleged support for a rival to Museveni in a presidential election.", "question": "Kigali", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "In March, Uganda declared Rwanda a hostile nation because of tensions arising from Kigali's alleged support for a rival to Museveni in a presidential election.", "question": "a rival to Museveni in a presidential election", "answer": ["w", "Kigali"]}, {"text": "GATUNA, Rwanda, July 6 (AFP) - President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni began talks here Friday in a bid to mend soured relations between their neighbouring countries.", "question": "their neighbouring countries", "answer": ["w", "Uganda"]}, {"text": "The formerly close allies fell out in 1999, the year after each sent troops to back rebel movements in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, when mounting rivalry lead to violent clashes between their own armies there.", "question": "each", "answer": ["w", "President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni"]}, {"text": "In March, Uganda declared Rwanda a hostile nation because of tensions arising from Kigali's alleged support for a rival to Museveni in a presidential election.", "question": "Rwanda", "answer": ["w", "Uganda"]}], "context": "\\t\\nGATUNA, Rwanda, July 6 (AFP) - President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni began talks here Friday in a bid to mend soured relations between their neighbouring countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two heads of state met under an canvas awning set up for the occasion a few hundred metres (yards) from the Gatuna border post, an AFP correspondent reported. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The formerly close allies fell out in 1999, the year after each sent troops to back rebel movements in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, when mounting rivalry lead to violent clashes between their own armies there. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Museveni and Kagame have met three times since the fighting broke out in the DRC city of Kisangani, the main town in the northeast of the country, but without patching up their differences. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In March, Uganda declared Rwanda a hostile nation because of tensions arising from Kigali's alleged support for a rival to Museveni in a presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two countries have each accused the other of backing dissidents. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020314/20.38.10-27533": {"extract": [{"text": "Police seized 33,9000 euros -- believed to be earnings from smuggling operations -- in the apartment of the 35-year-old suspected ringleader.", "question": "33,9000 euros", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Another officer said the loose structure of the smuggling ring made the investigation more difficult.", "question": "the loose structure of the smuggling ring", "answer": ["w", "Another officer"]}, {"text": "He said that the bust was nevertheless a significant and successful strike against gangs and businesses engaged in human smuggling.", "question": "the bust", "answer": ["w", "Another officer"]}], "context": "\\t\\nHamburg -- Some 200 German Border Guard officers working in cooperation with the Hamburg prosecutors\\' office on Wednesday cracked a ring of Afghan smugglers who have been operating throughout Europe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Officials say that the smuggling ring had been illegally bringing fellow nationals into Germany via Austria since at least October 2001.

\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe do swear that I will be faithful to the laws of the Republic of Zimbabwe, so help me God,\" said Mugabe who was flanked by first lady Grace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Mugabe, who is from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), won last weekend\\'s presidential election by polling 1,685,212 against his closest rival Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) who polled 1,262,401 votes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n At the State House, where the ceremony was held, thousands of ZANU-PF supporters in clothing emblazoned with Mugabe\\'s portrait, were singing and dancing to celebrate his victory, with a hope that Mugabe will finally deliver on his promises to give them the land currently owned by the country\\'s white minority. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his inauguration speech shortly after he was sworn in as president, Mugabe vowed to continue with his government\\'s controversial land reform program. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He told thousands of cheering supporters that \"land reforms must proceed with greater speed and strength\" to shore up the economy, badly battered by years of political instability. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of Zimbabwe\\'s arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy, and we will do that through the land reforms,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In the run-up to the March 9-11 poll, critics had accused the Zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country\\'s closest-fought election since independence in 1980. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But he told the nation that in spite of stiff opposition to the agrarian reforms from powerful Western countries, especially the country\\'s former colonial power of Britain, he would press ahead to seize farms from whites and resettle blacks. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"That message has not been accepted in Britain, that Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans. This is our land, and we have no intention of owning a piece of land in Britain,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He described his victory in the poll as \"a stunning blow to imperialism\" and thanked African countries for supporting Zimbabwe in its stand-off with Western countries over the agrarian reforms. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Many African leaders have supported Mugabe\\'s re-election victory in Zimbabwe\\'s crucial election, which they said was \" transparent, credible, free and fair\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Mugabe said Zimbabwe needed their continued support against what he called hostile international attention. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"When they aim at Zimbabwe, it is not Zimbabwe alone, they have other countries in mind.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his campaign for re-election, the Zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused Britain and its Western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in Zimbabwe, and the region, by installing a compliant opposition party in power. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Thanks to the people, our people and the people of Africa for this joint effort in rejecting this neocolonial attempt. Africa is for Africans,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n South African President Thabo Mbeki and President Olusegun Obasanjo are expected in Harare Monday for talks with the Zimbabwean leader on a possible government of national unity. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two, along with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, are members of a Commonwealth panel charged with assessing the election and recommending possible action by the group against Zimbabwe. The panel was scheduled to meet in London on Tuesday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow Britain and the United States to save face over their insistence on the MDC\\' s victory in Zimbabwe\\'s election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The European Union (EU) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A final communique issued on Saturday evening after the Barcelona EU summit said, \"The European Union will maintain its humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe and will consider possible additional targeted measures against its government.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Sunday\\'s inauguration ceremony was boycotted by EU countries, the US and some members of the Commonwealth. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Also, the opposition\\'s 57 members of parliament stayed away. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his inaugural address, Mugabe extended an olive branch to the opposition to join him in rebuilding the country\\'s economy, which has suffered three years of consecutive decline, but did not say in what role. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Our energy is better spent on reviving the economy than plotting to bring down each other,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The call to all of us, whether in the ruling party or in the opposition, is that we unite and come together as one people. There are areas where we must work together because we have a common destiny,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The MDC party rejected the voting results, claiming the government rigged the poll in favor of incumbent President Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n MDC leader Tsvangirai said pre-election violence prevented his party from campaigning in rural areas, the stronghold of the ruling party, and that thousands of his supporters in towns were disenfranchised when they failed to vote because authorities reduced polling centers in urban areas. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The ZANU-PF government denied rigging the election, saying Mugabe won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU-PF\\'s land policy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Analysts said Mugabe received much of his votes from the rural areas, where voter turnout was considered much higher than in towns and cities. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020306/20.49.12-24038": {"extract": [{"text": "In March 2001, the US administration opposed the protocol by saying

He simply condenses his foreign policy for others to easily understand by distinguishing the evil from the good. He claims that he belongs to the good side and whoever is on the other side is the evil that must be destroyed or at least deserves condemnation. It is not enough that he sees those countries as evil, he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well. For the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil, they are considered to be enemies of the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The events on 11 September forced Bush to overhaul the US foreign policy. Foreign policy was an issue that he never wanted to deal with before. Many believed that Bush was naive about foreign affairs. In the presidential election, he campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through. But the unexpected happened and what followed -- Usama Bin Ladin and the war in Afghanistan -- have elevated foreign policy to become the central part of his administration. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The circumstance has led Bush to again adopt an aggressive policy. He has declared that the war against terrorism will not end at Afghanistan but will spread to other parts of the world. It does not matter where in the world, he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As Bush has declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the \"Axis of Evil,\" it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons, be they chemical, biological, or nuclear. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The line that Bush draws between friends and foes has never been any clearer. Basically, he is telling the world the enemies of America is not just al-Qa\\'ida or Usama Bin Ladin. The countries that possess the lethal weapons are the targets of suppression by the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A close look will show that the United States has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned. For example, some 660 US soldiers have been dispatched to the Philippines to join Filipino soldiers to suppress the Abu Sayyaf. Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser, the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The new US policy deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored. It is necessary for Thai people to understand the important change in the policy of the country whose economic, political, and military influence impact on the world the most. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the US policy, the United States is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with the countries that Washington regards as enemies. This may result in more intense armed confrontation. The terrorist groups may step up sabotage of US targets and the US allies. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US naming of North Korea may annoy China, given its assistance to the United States in the war in Afghanistan. Iran tried to become more helpful to the United States during the war in Afghanistan, but now that it has been identified as an \"evil\" it likely will readjust its stance. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The world has heated up a notch. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020320/12.04.49-21742": {"extract": [{"text": "Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth.", "question": "Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki", "answer": ["w", "the vast majority of the Commonwealth"]}, {"text": "But how could Blair have \"a Commonwealth report\" when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members, asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat?", "question": "Blair", "answer": ["w", "one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders"]}, {"text": "But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election.", "question": "the BBC", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election -

Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Blair\\'s second faux pas in Australia, according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders, came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe\\'s Foreign Minister, Dr Stan Mudenge. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Nigerian leader, President Olusegun Obasanjo, had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain\\'s negative position regarding Zimbabwe, but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Zimbabwean minister did this. Then Mudenge rose to his feet, strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The hand symbolised reconciliation; and Blair accepted it. Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser, Britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders: How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported \"Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe\" when they had not? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Meanwhile, back in Harare, some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government-owned Sheraton Hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n There, unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper The Herald is distributed to guests, the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Furthermore, as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify, many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme. Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n During the 2000 parliamentary elections, 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Instead, an Australian member of the Federal Parliament, Julie Bishop, vented her anger towards the President and Government, and the electoral process, in Australia\\'s media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions. Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers? Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of \"consensus\", she and others of a similar view were dismissed as \"troublemakers\" by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday\\'s inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country\\'s decision to condemn Zimbabwe\\'s presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n And close by, Howard will have the British government and the western media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n And, in line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n No doubt Blair will fight on. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa, not with the people of Britain and Europe.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020312/21.16.59-4123": {"extract": [{"text": "Indonesia has come under pressure from several quarters to take tougher action against alleged terrorist leaders but has played
