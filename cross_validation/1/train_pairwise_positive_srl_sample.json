Robinson, who is due to attend discussions on human rights education and meet President Jiang Zemin during her two-day trip, began the visit by signing an agreement between the UN and China on further cooperation in human rights dialogue during 2002.   Afterwards, answering questions alongside co-signatory Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya, she made it clear measures to crack down on terrorism should not be used to justify rights abuses.   The former Irish president said she was concerned at \"a worrying trend in a number of countries to use the excuse of combating terrorism to clamp down on freedom of expression and legitimate dissent which is not violent\".  She specifically highlighted the situation of the ethnic Uighhur Muslim population of Xinjiang, China's furthest west region, where rights groups have claimed a crackdown against separatists has been stepped up since the September 11 attacks on the United States.
