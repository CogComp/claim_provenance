The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden. This is Sweden\\'s most serious incident so far involving radiation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden. When the container was transshipped in Paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the US Transport Department. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The container with the radioactive substance iridium 192 was transshipped at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris by the shipping company Federal Express. The pilot who was supposed to fly the container to the US was equipped with a dosimeter, which measures radiation levels. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US Transport Department has now informed Studsvik that the measurements done by Federal Express in Paris showed no abnormality.

the 1970s. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The first was issued during then-president Richard Nixon\\'s landmark trip to China in 1972 while another one, signed during the Ronald Reagan era, agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Wu defended the government\\'s cautious approach warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Taiwan\\'s interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei,\" Wu warned. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Taipei was angered when then-president Bill Clinton pledged the \"three nos\" during his China visit in 1998. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Clinton said he did not support independence for Taiwan, the policy of \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan\" and agreed that Taiwan should not be a member of any organisation to which statehood is a requirement. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011130/12.26.48-19550":

amassing huge quantities of arms and ammunition using two African allies in preparation for next year\\'s crucial presidential election, it has been established. Financial Gazette investigations in the past one-and-a-half months have revealed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Namibia are helping Zimbabwe circumvent an international arms embargo to buy huge quantities of guns and bullets for next year\\'s ballot. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The arms embargo was imposed on Harare last year by Europe and the United States on President Robert Mugabe\\'s government because of its appalling human rights record. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The investigations show that Zimbabwe is importing and massing an assortment of guns at army bases around the country in preparation for the poll, which is expected to be violent. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Most of the guns have been arriving secretly at Suri Suri airbase in Chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The bulk of the weapons have arrived from the DRC in that country\\'s military cargo plane. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The weapons consist of a significant portion of French-made guns, most of which top government sources say will be distributed to war veterans who are central to the ruling ZANU PF party\\'s re-election strategy in the presidential poll. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The sources say Zimbabwe, after the massive depletion of its armoury because of its participation in the three-year-old DRC war, has been finding it extremely difficult to replenish its arms stocks because its traditional and cheaper arms suppliers in Europe are refusing to sell it arms. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This had forced the army to implement some unpalatable measures, including the grounding of most of its entire fleet of Hawk fighter aircraft due to Britain\\'s refusal to sell spare parts. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Virtually all European Union member states have severed ties with Zimbabwe and imposed an arms embargo on the country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Although we can still buy a number of arms from countries like Russia and China, a greater part of our fairly priced weapons, ammunition and spares have been sourced from mainly European countries like Britain, Sweden, France and others over the years. We can no longer buy arms from Europe at the moment because of the problems here,\" said a top Ministry of Defence source. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We have been left with no alternative but to buy some weapons via our allies in the DRC who have access to some of these European weapons that we have preference for.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi declined to comment on the allegations of sanctions busting and the massing of guns at army bases around the country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Just avoid that one for now. I am not going to comment on that one,\" Sekeramayi said yesterday before immediately cutting off his telephone. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Asked why weapons of French origin were finding their way into Zimbabwe in an interview last month, Jerome Sautier, the first counsellor at the French embassy in Harare, and Lieutenant Colonel Dault, the defence attache, said France was not selling any arms to Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two said they had no knowledge of the arrival of French arms in the country but said France sold arms to several African countries which could in turn re-sell them to other countries. They said they did not know whether this was the case with Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"In Africa, we have military relationships with many countries. We have, for instance, sold arms to many French-speaking countries. These arms can in turn be re-sold by those other countries,\" said Sautier, adding that there was also the possibility of illegal arms trafficking outside the authority of the French government. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The first secretary at the Namibian High Commission in Harare, Mati Jose, said he had no knowledge of Namibia helping Zimbabwe to bust the arms embargo while the DRC\\'s ambassador to Zimbabwe Mawapanga Mwanananga could not be reached for comment. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Authoritative military sources said the army will be training and arming war veterans to ensure that Mugabe is re-elected in the ballot which must be held by the end of March. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A number of bases have been established for the war veterans throughout Zimbabwe, particularly in those areas which did not have army camps. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The sources said the war veterans will operate from these bases, their main objective being to make it impossible for the MDC to campaign in rural areas. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Opposition supporters would also be harassed and ejected out of the rural areas to disable them from voting in their constituencies. A number of war veterans have in fact already been armed. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said in a statement that ZANU PF supporters who smashed MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai\\'s vehicle and thwarted his planned meeting with his party\\'s structures in Sanyati last week were armed with guns. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A senior government official said: \"I sympathize with

He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is only natural, with the guerilla operations successively occur, even inside the fortified settlements, that the world begins to wonder whether the accusations that Arafat was planning, and instructing attacks on Israeli targets despite his captivity, and the round-the-clock Israeli surveillance, were founded. The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The failure of the US-made Israeli war machine to settle this unequal battle became clear in the farcical-yet-provocative, statements made by the Israeli minister of defense now present in Washington. He has called for helping aggressive Israel to put a traitorous agent at the head of the Palestinian Authority, who could accept its terms to \"assassinate\\' the rights of Palestinians. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is certain the Ben Eliezer\\'s hallucination is a mere expression of failure to persuade the world to accept the brutality of the occupying forces\\' practices. They even embody the bankrupt policy of Israeli criminal extremism and failure to gain legitimacy for its continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Ben Eliezer\\'s raving coincided with the arrival of his assassin boss Sharon to Washington to take part in exerting pressures on the US administration, and persuade it that removing Arafat could bring about the Palestinian surrender, and halt violence as he calls it. Sharon and Ben Eliezer never stopped to consider that no patriotic Palestinian could accept to serve as a substitute agent to Israel. They, along with the extremist gang in the Israeli government, do not want to understand that Arafat symbolizes the Palestinian struggle. With this attitude, Sharon\\'s government showed its true hostility for a leader and chairman elected by his people. US peace Envoy Burns has expressed this after his meeting with president Mubarak. He has declared that US contacts will continue with Arafat considering that he is the elected Palestinian chairman. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n I do wish that Burns\\'s statements reflect a true position that signals a return of balance to the US position in dealing with the reality of Palestinian-Israeli struggle. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The time has come, gentlemen, for Sharon, the assassin, to realize that injustice cannot last long. The security of the Israelis depends on the Palestinians\\' regaining their rights. By besieging Arafat, Sharon has turned him into the \"Mandela\" of Arab struggle. This foretells that the Israeli occupation\\'s claims will inevitably falls, no matter how long Sharon humiliates Arab dignity, relaying on the protection and support of Washington, which forgot all principles and role in defending justice, and international legitimacy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020327/20.50.33-2917": {"extract": [{"text": "The Finance Minister says he hopes, for Mercosur, something similar to what happened in the EU: \"an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down, like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting, that see the difficulties as being insurmountable, and the problems as being unsolvable.\"", "question": "the difficulties", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "some countries"]}, {"text": "The Minister says that after the October elections in Brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years.", "question": "changes", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "Argentina"]}, {"text": "Given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the Finance Minister says.", "question": "the approach", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "Whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the European Union\\'s experience,\" the Minister says.", "question": "Whoever says that these are small steps", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "Based on this effort of statistical harmonization, we announced, in December 2000, an agreement for basic convergence parameters.", "question": "basic convergence parameters", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "We"]}, {"text": "The presidents of the six countries endorsed certain goals in relation to the debt, GDP, nominal deficits as a proportion of the six countries' GDPs, and maximum inflation.", "question": "certain goals in relation to the debt, GDP, nominal deficits as a proportion of the six countries' GDPs, and maximum inflation", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "The presidents of the six countries"]}, {"text": "The Minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy.", "question": "the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "The Minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy.", "question": "dollarizing the Brazilian economy", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "He suggests the definition of a series of priorities.", "question": "the definition of a series of priorities", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "But Caruana said that the banks \"did their homework\" and made provisions for their investments in Argentina.", "question": "the banks", "answer": ["w", "Jaime Caruana"]}, {"text": "This, the Minister insists, is why \"it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks,\" referring to what the IMF and some governments, like that of the United States, are asking.", "question": "to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "\"The priority now is to unshackle the credit system, for there is no modern economy that can function without credit.", "question": "the credit system", "answer": ["w", "Finance Minister Pedro Malan"]}, {"text": "To Malan, however, more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense -

According to Malan, another approach is necessary in this period of transition of the Argentine crisis. He suggests the definition of a series of priorities. \"The priority now is to unshackle the credit system, for there is no modern economy that can function without credit. Credit needs banks, a functioning payment system. This priority is urgent right now,\" he told participants in the seminar on \"The Euro and Brazil,\" organized by this newspaper. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Malan criticizes the stance taken by multilateral institutions like the IMF, who are asking for reforms in Argentina before the country can receive financial help. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy\\'s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the Finance Minister says. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Pedro Malan\\'s attitude in relation to Argentina is very different from that of Jaime Caruana, governor of the Bank of Spain, the Spanish central bank. To Caruana, Argentina has to \"create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Spain is one of the leading investors in Argentina, whose instability had a big impact on the results of Spanish banks in 2001. But Caruana said that the banks \"did their homework\" and made provisions for their investments in Argentina. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to Argentina, a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country, recounting their experiences in situations like the one the Argentines are facing. In the group were former Bank of Mexico Governor Miguel Mancera, who dealt with the peso crisis in 1995; a former Chilean Central Bank president who faced the 1982 crisis, when the Chilean GDP dropped by 14 percent; former IMF Fiscal Affairs Director Vito Tanzi; an expert in restructuring the Spanish debt; and former Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola, who lived through the time of the Collor government\\'s withholdings and of the Proer [Program to Encourage the Reorganization and Strengthening of the National Financial System] - the program to restructure the Brazilian banking system. In Argentina\\'s defense, Malan says that Brazil\\'s Mercosur partner \"has sought to define with clarity the fundamental issues of its basic regimes - foreign exchange (floating exchange rate regime), monetary (they intend, after phase of transition, to define their inflation goal system, which was important to Spain from 1995-1998) and fiscal.\" This, the Minister insists, is why \"it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks,\" referring to what the IMF and some governments, like that of the United States, are asking. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Malan defends a single currency for Mercosur. \"We want to keep alight the flame of a single currency in the region in future, even if a distant one,\" but until then, \"there is the job of consolidating the institutions in the political and institutional sphere, of productive restructuring and of modernizing the State\" in six countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy. \"We do not want to yield on Brazil\\'s having its own currency, its regional currency. Dollarization is a not very trivial process of negotiation with the country that issues the currency, in this case the dollar, involving complex questions about the role of ultimate lender, the role of the Federal Reserve in the supervision and regulation of the banks in the dollarized country.\" According to Malan, the dollarization process is irreversible. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina, resulting from the floating of the real in 1999, will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system. Malan predicts that Argentina will be more competitive when it emerges from the crisis. \"A little calm is needed, the ability to look ahead, not let oneself be carried by the difficulties of the moment,\" he emphasizes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to the Minister, Mercosur managed, after an \"enormous technical effort,\\' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, Bolivia and Chile, which were not comparable before. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Today we have comparable statistics; there is a macroeconomic monitoring group in the Finance Ministry and experts from the six countries\\' central banks who meet regularly. Based on this effort of statistical harmonization, we announced, in December 2000, an agreement for basic convergence parameters. The presidents of the six countries endorsed certain goals in relation to the debt, GDP, nominal deficits as a proportion of the six countries\\' GDPs, and maximum inflation. Whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the European Union\\'s experience,\" the Minister says. According to Malan, \"long marches start with first steps.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This was an important step that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called a little Maastricht, that is, the search for convergence parameters that serve as a reference point for talks between experts from the six countries, the Minister says. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n To Malan, however, more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense - structural, macro and microeconomic ones. The Finance Minister says he hopes, for Mercosur, something similar to what happened in the EU: \"an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down, like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting, that see the difficulties as being insurmountable, and the problems as being unsolvable.\" Malan defends a different posture: \"to set aside the notion of cynicism, skepticism, that things will not work out,\" and believe, like the Europeans, that there is a future to be built by the Mercosur countries and Chile and Bolivia, the associate members. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Minister says that after the October elections in Brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years.

envoy. His task was to create \"a peaceful environment\" in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The man who defeated Iraq in 1991 in only six weeks issued a message, saying that the most he hoped for was something less than a mutual cease-fire agreement. Another round of talks will be held today between Powell and the chief players in the Middle East. But the current development of events, that is, the standstill situation, makes it clear that US foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the United States needs to discipline its decades-long ally, Israel, and not ruin its relations with the Arabs. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The impression is that, under US sponsorship, the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East. The latest round of violence was initiated on the day in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon took it upon himself to provoke his Muslim neighbors by visiting an Islamic religious building. Sharon, who used to be a colonel and who is directly responsible for the massacre in the Beirut camps Sabra and Shatila, used his return to power as an opportunity to settle the accounts with his years-long enemies. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Powell\\'s words, \"we are working on this plan,\" are unclear, because he did not say what the plan is, and Israel\\'s call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear. In relation to the first ambiguity, Powell\\'s words definitely cannot be taken seriously, considering that precisely Washington is the one that has been practicing a one-sided approach to the events in the Middle East for 18 months now and it was the chief opponent of the positioning of peace troops between the two warring sides. With an average $3 billion military aid for Israel and a strong Jewish lobby at home, the Untied States cannot play any other role in the Middle East conflict but protector of the Israeli state. In its warnings and appeals for peace, the United States openly \"takes a side\" in this conflict, labeling the other side terrorists, similar to those who carried out the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It would be entirely improper if, in its defense of Israel, the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries, such as, Syria and Lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the Hezbolah. It is worrying that among Powell\\'s priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front. In some circles, these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel-Palestine problem with a bigger one. For example, a new Israeli-Arab war. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East. Maybe Joschka Fischer\\'s plan for suspending Germany\\'s military aid for Israel, that is, possible EU economic sanctions against Tel Aviv is honorable, but it is a late and disturbingly long-term plan. Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, and the Palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The EU\\'s efforts and US President Bush\\'s peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution, considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia\\'s heir to the throne, Prince Abdullah, which contained two points: recognition of a Palestinian state [as published] in an Arab neighborhood, in return for recognition of the Palestinians\\' right to their own country. Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan, demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab. In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine, labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020509/22.11.01-7259": {"extract": [{"text": "In countries such as China and India where AIDS was still at an early phase of the AIDS pandemic, timely control measures were critical to head off an explosive growth in infection, but these demanded heavy expenditure, he said.", "question": "timely control measures", "answer": ["w", "Michel Sidibe, Director of the Country and Regional Support Department of UNAIDS"]}, {"text": "However, low-income countries would be able to pay 14 billion U.

the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert. The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech, Morocco at the start of the month. If the protocol, which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases, is put into effect, the nation\\'s export will be heavily damaged. The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union (EU) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990\\'s. The government and business circle expect the nation\\'s exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008, when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol. The reason is that South Korea\\'s industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol. Also, advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier. Moreover, the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen. South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers, and Korea\\'s per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries. Under this situation, the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations. In particular, Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States\\' ratification of the protocol. The U.S. backed out of the agreement, saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore. Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018, there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then. If things go on like this, the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment-friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing. The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency. According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol\\'s requirements. \"The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption,\" an industry source said.

Shuttleworth agreed that this was essential towards Africa\\'s rebirth. He said he had seen the most magnificent sunset and sunrise over Africa, at which Mbeki asked him to bring pictures \"so that we can know what we look like to you from up there\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n South Africans should be looking up smiling when he returns, Shuttleworth replied. Shuttleworth also expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete, who died on Friday night, a message Mbeki undertook to convey. The president then toasted Shuttleworth with a glass of champagne, saying: \"I am sure this will go down in our history as one of those moments where we made quite a leap forward.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Shuttleworth, accompanied by Russian flight commander Yury Gidzenko and Italian cosmonaut Roberto Vittori, reached the ISS at 0755 GMT, two days after blasting off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The world\\'s second space tourist, Shuttleworth was paying 20 million dollars for his 10-day journey into space, where he would carry out experiments into the HI virus which causes AIDS. The team is to return to earth on May 5. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Source : Sapa /mlr/shob Date : 27 Apr 2002 14:16\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020218/20.45.17-5753": {"extract": [{"text": "Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al-Qa'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran, which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would act if provided with evidence.", "question": "al-Qa'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran", "answer": ["w", "Washington", "Tehran"]}, {"text": "In another verbal attack Kharazi accused the United States of wanting to exercise \"world dictatorship\" since the \"horrible attacks\" of September 11.", "question": "the United States", "answer": ["w", "Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi"]}, {"text": "The German government spokesman said it would be \"useful\" if UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction.", "question": "UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction", "answer": ["w", "Uwe-Karsten Heye"]}, {"text": "Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pledged \"undivided support\" for the fight against terrorism a week after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, saying, \"Germany is ready for risks, including military ones, but not for adventures.\"", "question": "undivided support\" for the fight against terrorism", "answer": ["w", "Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder"]}, {"text": "\"But the leaders I\\'ve talked to understand, exactly, what needs to happen.", "question": "the leaders I've talked to", "answer": ["w", "US President George W.

\"useful\" if UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer last week sharply criticised Bush\\'s \"axis of

that some 150 foreigners arrested recently on Iran\\'s border with Pakistan were not members of the al-Qaeda terror network, but admitted some could be sympathisers and would be sent back to their

\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A diplomatic source said the affair could become \"embarrassing\" for European countries, \"because of the insistence of the Americans on judging for themselves\" those who supported al-Qaeda. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al-Qa\\'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran, which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would

described Pakistan as mother of terrorism and said if the world has to rid itself from this menace, the perpetrators across the border had to be dealt with firmly. He said mere positioning of army at borders was not enough as infiltration was still continuing. The ultras were indulging in blood-shed and their lunaticism has touched such heights that they were not even sparing the worship places, he said and referred to the attack in Raghunath bazaar and temple complex. He cautioned the people against the enemy and said that extra vigil will certainly help in nabbing suspects. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Reiterating that Pakistan will not give up terror, the Chief Minister said that ultimately the demon they have reared will eat up their own vitals. 'Those digging graves for others, get engraved themselves', he said while citing the example of Afghanistan. He said Pakistan is attempting hard to put India in communal flames so that forces are withdrawn from the borders to deal with the internal situations, thereby leaving field day for ultras to cross over to this side. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Dr Abdullah also dwelt on the spread of education saying that teaching younger generation means steering the nation to prosperity and progress. 'Concentrate on those today who are the builders of nation tomorrow', he asked the teachers community while appreciating the involvement of parents in career building of their wards. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Responding to the demands put forth in a memorandum by the residents of Chhanni Himmat, Narwal, Malik Marker Bye-Pass, Chhanni Bija, Chhanni Rama, Chhanni Kamala and Ambedkar Nagar, the Chief Minister said that he will get examined the issue regarding addition of 11th and 12th classes in the area. He called for launching a coaching class for various competitive exams, as the area has no such facility. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Dr Abdullah also dwelt on various social services in the area and said that answer to meeting the growing demand of tap water in various localities of Jammu is tapping of Chenab water for the purpose. In this regard, he said, a Rs 400 crore scheme had been prepared a few years back that is currently under process for implementation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Expressing concern over dwindling moral values in the society, the Chief Minister said that youngsters must get inspiration from their glorious past and respect their parents and teachers.
