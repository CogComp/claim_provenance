The worst affected areas are Dallas, Majengo and the Shauri Yako slums with a population of 17,000 people. Dr Kangangi, an assistant director of medical services attached to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme, said 56 per cent of those infected with TB were also HIV-positive.

Yesterday, Dr Kangangi carried out random checks on hundreds of residents in Dallas estate. He was accompanied by the Embu Medical Officer of Health, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, and a team of health personnel. The medic blamed the outbreak on congestion in the slums and failure to observe basic hygienic practices. The residents are being advised to ensure that their houses were well ventilated to avoid multiplication of germs.

is deeply concerned about the sudden deterioration in the Middle East situation, Tang said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Arafat, as leader of the Palestinian people and one of the initiators of peace talks between Israel and Palestine, has made great efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process, Tang said, stressing that disastrous consequences would happen to the Middle East region if unexpected incidents took place to Arafat\\'s safety. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Tang expressed his hope that Israel will implement Resolution 1402 of the United Nations Security Council unconditionally, withdraw its troops completely from Palestinian areas and solve the problems through peaceful means. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Tang asked Israel to do so in order to serve the overall requirement of security and stability in the Middle East as well as Israel\\'s own long-term interest. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The pressing matter of the moment is that Israel and Palestine should both exercise maximum restraint and adopt concrete measures to stop the conflict immediately and create conditions for resumption of the peace talks, Tang said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Peres briefed Tang on the latest development of the conflict between the two sides. In response to Tang\\'s enquiry, he expressed that Israel is willing to promise to the international community that Israel will not threaten Arafat\\'s personal safety and will not destroy the Palestine National Authority. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020206/20.23.00-9795": {"extract": [{"text": "Comparing it with 19 April 1810 is another armed coup and must be rejected with all

No one had ever tried to compare themselves to, and put themselves in the same position, as the founders of the nation, as the thwarted leader of the 4 February 1992 coup has now tried to do. What is there about a coup against the constitutional order that could resemble the most important day in Venezuelan history? In what way can Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez be seen as comparable to Jose Felix Ribas, Francisco Salias, the philosopher Juan German Roscio, or Canon Jose Cortes de Madariaga? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n No. This is a simple lack of respect, an abuse of history, an unacceptable degradation. Chavez did not try to overthrow Fernando VII, and if it had been up to him we would still be under the domination of the Bourbon dynasty. 4 February is one of the most terrible days in Venezuelan history. If he wants to look for a comparison, maybe he would find one in the likewise thwarted coup by Colonel Pedro Carujo against Jose Maria Vargas. Comparing it with 19 April 1810 is another armed coup and must be rejected with all determination by the academies and by those who in one way or another must preserve our historical legacy from adulteration or deceitful use. 4 February upset the lives of Venezuelans with the ghost of a military insurgency that we had all thought had been overcome, because it belonged to past eras and because the armed forces were fully within the legitimate order, complying with institutional precepts, far from the meddling forbidden by the constitution. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In fact, the armed forces made great contributions to the country\\'s stability, because when each sector of Venezuelan society complies with what is set out for it in the legal order, countries are preserved from the vicissitudes of coup plotters. President Chavez himself now boasts of having spent 20 years conspiring -- that is, eroding the armed forces\\' loyalty -- to achieve his goal of conquering power. This is a great demonstration of political cynicism. 4 February was not only a military failure for Chavez; it was also an episode that caused enormous losses, human and economic, for all Venezuelans. There were numerous deaths, and no one can feel proud of the consequences. 4 February was such a failure that Chavez, even though it pained him, had to accept democratic methods to reach power. That was what happened in 1998, and still today, Chavez gives constant demonstrations of discontent and irritation at having been democratically elected. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The reason for this is simple: He has to respect the democratic rules of the game, the freedom of expression that causes him so many nightmares, the presence of the fundamental institutions of the nation whose right to exist he denies. He wants to disguise the failed date of 4 February to create the collective illusion of a military victory, which would permit him to govern us from Miraflores as if he really had reached power that day. Imagine what would have happened to us Venezuelans if in fact on that terrible day the lieutenant colonel, instead of staying in the museum, had advanced on the government building with the vast forces backing him. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Once he was taken prisoner, democracy exhausted all its generosity, just as Vargas did with Carujo. Venezuelan democracy has not given anyone as much as it gave Chavez. He should acknowledge these debts and make the effort to learn to live in a democracy, respecting others\\' rights.

Israel does not want the Palestinians to be part of the same country, or have one of their own. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n By a margin of 2-1, Israelis think Sharon has no plan to end the violence and the buffer idea buttresses this long-standing view.

And now he doggedly continues to demolish and prevent any hope of a road to peaceful coexistence. Israelis do not wonder any longer how to get along with Palestinians but how to avoid the need for it. Sharon has ensured that Israelis are rapidly absorbing the lesson that no place in Israel can be considered safe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A wall and miles of fences is not the best of solutions.

That must rank as the understatement of the year. The story could have devastating consequence for the Bush administration. A week ago, after Chavez had been reinstated by his supporters, the White House denied any role in the failed military coup, although it admitted that US officials had met Venezuelan opposition leaders beforehand. But they had been told that Chavez, whose friendship with Libya, Iraq and Cuba has angered Washington, should only be replaced by legitimate, constitutional means; the US would not support a coup. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The question now is: Did the White House lie? If it turns out to be true that the two US colonels were involved in the failed attempt, there can be no other conclusion. The two colonels would not have been acting on their own. They must have been under orders -- orders stretching all the way back to the Oval Office. This spells serious trouble for Bush. The whiff of scandal and conspiracy is in the air -- and the American media, ever addicted to conspiracy theories, is not going to let it go. It -- and the opposition Democrats, still smarting at his election victory -- will dig for dirt as long it takes. Even if it finally turns out that the two colonels were operating without the knowledge and approval of the White House, it will be a disaster for Bush. Americans will want to know who exactly is running their country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For the rest of the world, however, the story already confirms the suspicions that the Bush administration is hell-bent on eliminating its enemies by whatever means possible, legal or illegal. The involvement of US military personnel in the putsch suggests a return to the old days when the CIA would organize coups and assassinations to further US interests. The record is long and to Washington's eternal discredit: the CIA's attempts to kill Fidel Castro, its involvement in the coups in Guatemala in 1954 and in Chile in 1973. President Clinton had, it was thought, closed the book on such nefarious activities. Apparently not. The Clinton era turns out to have been merely an interlude. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Coup making might have been acceptable during the Cold War. It certainly is not any more. Chavez may be a petty-minded populist who had done great damage to his country's economy; but he is also the legitimately elected president of Venezuela. Any US involvement in the attempt to remove him by force puts Washington firmly on the wrong side of international law. What makes it all the worse at this particular point in time is that it makes a mockery of George Bush's war against international terrorism. The world, he says, has to be involved in the struggle against those who seek to attack and destroy law and order and legitimate government. Yet he throws law, order and legitimacy to the wind when it suits him. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011008/21.49.24-6596": {"extract": [{"text": "But, Koizumi has not changed his plan to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site of the 1937 clash that led to an eight-year war between Japan and China, and a nearby museum commemorating China's anti-Japanese movement, they said.", "question": "visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site of the 1937 clash that led to an eight-year war between Japan and China, and a nearby museum commemorating China's anti-Japanese movemen", "answer": ["w", "government officials", "Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi"]}], "context": "\\t\\n[Computer selected and disseminated without FBIS editorial intervention] \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Tokyo, Oct. 8 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi will shorten his one-day visit to China on Monday by three hours due to the launch of U.S. and British retaliatory strikes in Afghanistan for the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the United States, government officials said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Koizumi left for Beijing on Monday morning an hour after the originally scheduled time and will return to Tokyo two hours earlier than scheduled, the officials said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But, Koizumi has not changed his plan to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site of the 1937 clash that led to an eight-year war between Japan and China, and a nearby museum commemorating China's anti-Japanese movement, they said.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020228/21.12.01-14811": {"extract": [{"text": "Head of International Cooperation Department of Romania's Nuclearelectrica Teodor Chirica says that the VVER-1000 technology to be contributed by Russian experts is accepted in the world because is coated for protection and built on US and German supervision and automation systems.", "question": "the VVER-1000 technology to be contributed by Russian experts", "answer": ["w", "Teodor Chirica"]}, {"text": "Head of International Cooperation Department of Romania's Nuclearelectrica Teodor Chirica says that the VVER-1000 technology to be contributed by Russian experts is accepted in the world because is coated for protection and built on US and German supervision and automation systems.", "question": "VVER-1000 technology", "answer": ["w", "Teodor Chirica", "the world"]}, {"text": "Romania has built the first reactor at the Cernavoda n-plant on Canadian technology, having opted for a CANDU type of reactor instead of Russia's VVER-4000.", "question": "a CANDU type of reactor", "answer": ["w", "Romania"]}, {"text": "On a recent visit to Turkey, Romania's Prime Minister Adrian Nastase presented his Turkish counterpart Bulent Ecevit the advantages of investments in the plant at Cernavoda, which include a generation price of $12/MWh.", "question": "investments in the plant at Cernavoda", "answer": ["w", "Romania's Prime Minister Adrian Nastase"]}, {"text": "Given the stake at play, namely electricity exports, other countries have also voiced interest in contributing to the finalization of works on reactor III and IV at Cernavoda.", "question": "contributing to the finalization of works on reactor III and IV at Cernavoda", "answer": ["w", "other countries"]}], "context": "\\t\\nBucharest, Feb 28 [Rompres] -- The prospects for the construction of a new unit on Russian technology at Romania\\'s nuclear plant at Cernavoda were sketched out in Moscow during a visit by Romania\\'s Prime Minister Adrian Nastase on 21 February. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Head of International Cooperation Department of Romania\\'s Nuclearelectrica Teodor Chirica says that the VVER-1000 technology to be contributed by Russian experts is accepted in the world because is coated for protection and built on US and German supervision and automation systems. \"The Russians have just concluded contracts for the export of four similar reactors, two each to China and India,\" Chirica told daily Ziarul Financiar on Thursday [28 February]. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Romania has built the first reactor at the Cernavoda n-plant on Canadian technology, having opted for a CANDU type of reactor instead of Russia\\'s VVER-4000.

For the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil, they are considered to be enemies of the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The events on 11 September forced Bush to overhaul the US foreign policy. Foreign policy was an issue that he never wanted to deal with before. Many believed that Bush was naive about foreign affairs. In the presidential election, he campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through. But the unexpected happened and what followed -- Usama Bin Ladin and the war in Afghanistan -- have elevated foreign policy to become the central part of his administration. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The circumstance has led Bush to again adopt an aggressive policy. He has declared that the war against terrorism will not end at Afghanistan but will spread to other parts of the world. It does not matter where in the world, he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As Bush has declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the \"Axis of Evil,\" it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons, be they chemical, biological, or nuclear. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The line that Bush draws between friends and foes has never been any clearer. Basically, he is telling the world the enemies of America is not just al-Qa\\'ida or Usama Bin Ladin. The countries that possess the lethal weapons are the targets of suppression by the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A close look will show that the United States has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned. For example, some 660 US soldiers have been dispatched to the Philippines to join Filipino soldiers to suppress the Abu Sayyaf. Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser, the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The new US policy deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored. It is necessary for Thai people to understand the important change in the policy of the country whose economic, political, and military influence impact on the world the most. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the US policy, the United States is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with the countries that Washington regards as enemies. This may result in more intense armed confrontation. The terrorist groups may step up sabotage of US targets and the US allies. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US naming of North Korea may annoy China, given its assistance to the United States in the war in Afghanistan. Iran tried to become more helpful to the United States during the war in Afghanistan, but now that it has been identified as an \"evil\" it likely will readjust its stance. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The world

The \"computers\" are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Such tiny devices could one day fit into cells and supervise biological processes, or even synthesize drugs. DNA strands exist in almost every body cell -- they are biological software that tell each cell and molecule what to do. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"If you look at the mechanism of a cell, a lot of what goes on inside is computation. We don\\'t need to teach the cell new tricks, we just need to put the existing tricks in the right order,\" says Prof. Ehud Shapiro of the Weizmann Institute, who headed the research. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips. Artificial chips have reached their limits and can\\'t get any smaller. But, say the scientists, tiny DNA strands can store huge amounts of information in minuscule space -- one cubic centimeter of DNA can store more information than a trillion CDs. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Prof. Shapiro says the molecular computer is the first of its kind. Although computers with DNA input and output have been made before, they have always involved a laborious series of reactions, each requiring human supervision. \"Previous biological computers were the same size as the room in which the supervisors and computer equipment worked,\" said Shapiro. \"With the new method, all you need do to get an answer is put all the ingredients into a test tube, mix them together, and check to see what the output is.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For now biological computers only know how to answer simple questions with a \"yes\" or \"no\" response. A typical question would be: In the sequence \"AAB\" is there an equal number of As and Bs? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Nevertheless, several researchers worldwide have hailed the computers as an important new development. \"They work better than anything I\\'ve seen so far,\" said Eric Baum, a computer scientist at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, New Jersey. Although he questions whether biomolecular computers will ever become really useful, he believes they are a \"step in the right direction.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Professor Shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe DNA-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The computer simulates the cell\\'s natural mechanisms with an accuracy level of 99.8 percent. Natural DNA processes also involve inaccuracies which are corrected by other genes, says Shapiro, and it is almost impossible to reach absolute accuracy using biological systems. However, for the uses for which the computers are designated, this level of accuracy is adequate. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n So how does such a computer work? Let\\'s say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a \"B\" DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even. The DNA section -- the \"input\" -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer\\'s \"hardware\". Other DNA sections are added, which act as \"software\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A software section sticks to the input with the help of an enzyme. If the tip of the input is \"B\", the input will be labeled as having an odd number of \"B\" sequences. Another enzyme then cuts the section and reveals the next sequence. Each time \"B\" appears, the label on the input changes from \"even\" to \"odd\" and back again. Once the computer has dissected the entire input, it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the \"output\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the \"B\" sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software DNAs.\\t\\n\\n\\n"},

The hijackers asked them for money--one million pesos was mentioned--which she had supposedly withdrawn from the bank. She told them she had not withdrawn such money and that she was the wife of a senior French diplomat.

Parliament, which convened yesterday in Strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem. In addition, the Parliament called for imposing a weapons embargo on Israel and the Palestinian Authority. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For some time, European politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with Israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between EU member states and Israel, could cause serious damage. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Earlier this week, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel, threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem. European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the EU should consider imposing an economic \"punishment\" on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories. The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Despite the Parliament\\'s recommendation, the chances that the association agreements will be suspended are very slim. It takes more than a recommendation from the European Parliament for this to happen; the decision has to be taken by both the European Commission and the EU\\'s Council of Foreign Ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Countries like France and Belgium are easily capable of voting for sanctions against Israel, but other states -- including Germany and Britain -- have exhibited a more balanced position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, the fact that certain countries have a more balanced view of the conflict is not the only reason to doubt that anti-Israeli decisions will, in fact, be adopted. The Europeans know that repeated denunciations of Israel, not to mention its punishment, will not lead to a solution of the conflict. Israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the European states eliminate customs breaks afforded to Israeli exports. If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena -- in a direction that many in Israel would support wholeheartedly -- they will not be able to promote their positions in such a manner. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A unilateral move is likely to prejudice Europe\\'s status in helping to find a solution to the conflict. EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten expressed this clearly Tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between Israel and the EU would do nothing to enhance Jerusalem\\'s readiness to listen to European representatives. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n What holds true with regard to threats by EU leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain European states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing. There have been reports that vital components German factories are supposed to supply to the defense establishment are arriving slowly, as is the case regarding the arrival of vital supplies from other European countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n One cannot assume that Israel will act under the pressure of deeds and oversights that are often tainted with a significant degree of hypocrisy.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20010817/23.25.24-13030": {"extract": [{"text": "Chang said after visiting Chinese communities in the United States, New Zealand and Southeast Asia that education and

Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States\\' traditional policy. After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush\\'s main foreign policy line. Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration\\'s diplomacy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Once coming to power, Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [NMD]. The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan. Despite the opposition, Bush went it alone. One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [AMD] by flashing a carrot on a stick. At one time, he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race; on another occasion, he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was \"a product of the Cold War era,\" and thus has lost its binding force. He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM. Over the past year, Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N!\\nMD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system. Even after the adoption of the resolution on \"maintaining and abiding by the \"Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly, the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test. In a word, the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of \"attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it,\" thereby genuinely securing its status of being the \"sole super power.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the \"two-isms\" in its diplomacy. In the plane collision event, if one goes by the US logic, only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people\\'s doorsteps; the host, on the other hand, does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard. The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side. The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that \"US crew members were detained by the Chinese side.\" It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government\\'s firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology.

This March, catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party, Bush announced, without prior consultations with its allies, that the United States would not enforce the \"Kyoto Protocol\" which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world. This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In July, the Bush administration decided to let the \"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\" \"freeze\" in the Senate. Hard on the heels of that decision, the US negotiation representative Marie Chevrier announced in Geneva that the Bush administration would not support the implementation of the \"Biological Weapons Convention\" and that the United States strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision.

It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n After the 11 September attacks on the United States, the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people. Supported by the world, the United States launched the \"war against terrorism\" of this century. Bush stressed that the war is not only the \"US war\" but also a \"world war.\" The United States views itself as a \"major force of anti-terrorism,\" for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. Bush said, \"Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists\" and \"any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.\" The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country\\'s attitude toward it. It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism. But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan. Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it.

Mostly, they accused Washington of violating national sovereignty after the US ranking official voiced an opinion about Venezuela\\'s foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of the administration of Hugo Chavez. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Last Tuesday, before the US Senate\\'s Foreign Policy Committee, Powell voiced his concern over \"several actions by President Chavez and his ideas of what is a democratic system.\" He also criticized the visits by the chief of state to countries that are on the black list of supporters of terrorism, published by the administration of President George W. Bush, including Cuba, Libya, and Iraq. Guillermo Garcia Ponce Click here to view picture of Garcia Ponce , chief of the board of directors of the Political Command of the Revolution [CPR], described Powell\\'s statement as \"unusual\" and added that it does not reflect the friendly relations between Caracas and Washington. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He stressed: \"Venezuela\\'s domestic policy is the exclusive concern of Venezuelans because of our historical tradition and because it is a constitutional mandate.\" He added: \"There is no reason for any country to request the agreement of others to determine its conduct and adopt its decisions.\" Garcia Ponce, who said he was speaking on behalf of the entire CPR, pointed out that it would be \"truly inconceivable\" that the interference of a state to approve or disapprove the decisions of another or other states became a trait of foreign policy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"This is not in keeping with the rules of international law and violates the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries,\" the top representative of the CPR noted. However, he ruled out that the statement by the US Foreign Secretary will lead to a change in the policies of President Chavez. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Deputy Cilia Flores, chief of bloc of the Fifth Republic Movement [MVR], used the same tone to express her opinion. Without mincing her words, she affirmed: \"This is an instance of meddling in the policies of this country, which is a sovereign country.\" She added: \"Venezuela designs its own policies in an autonomous manner and, in any event, it is up to Venezuelans to decide them. We respect the sovereignty of all countries and this is why we demand respect for ours.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As for the criticisms of the destinations of the presidential trips, she remarked: \"In addition to the fact that we do not have to ask anyone for permission to decide where and when we should visit a country, the President has visited countries with which we have direct trade relations, countries that are OPEC members, with the specific objective of strengthening our economy.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Noheli Pocaterra, vice president of the National Assembly, stressed that it is up to Venezuela to decide its foreign policy and the United States must respect its decision. According to her, the remarks by the US Government spokesman were uncalled-for. She stated: \"We are quite respectful of the decisions made by Washington, even if we do not agree with them. We demand equal treatment for our foreign policy.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The opposition seeks intervention or blockade [subhead] \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno went even further and established a direct relation between the concerns voiced by the Secretary of State and the disclosure of a video that presumably confirms relations between the Venezuelan Government and the Colombian rebel groups. Journalists Ibeyise Pacheco, Marta Colomina, Patricia Poleo, and Marianela Salazar disclosed this video in recent days. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The deputy said that Powell\\'s remarks did not surprise him and added that the US official\\'s opinion is based on reports published by the domestic and international press, which is waging a ruthless war against the Venezuelan chief of state. He noted: \"The opposition is succeeding at portraying an image of Venezuela that scares away investors and triggers domestic turmoil to request the intervention of foreign powers in the country.\" Thus, Carreno excused the White House official, whom - he argued - was misled by the smear campaign and information sabotage that has been unleashed against Chavez in the country and abroad. He took one further step and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see what is really happening. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He accused the four journalists of plotting with powerful economic groups that presumably contributed the funds to purchase the video from an intelligence agent. He stressed that these journalists should be tried since, according to Article 122 of the Penal Code, any action that instigates interventionist actions is considered treason against the homeland. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Carreno said: \"This is what they are trying to accomplish through this campaign and their conduct, which is not that of journalists but of opposition activists, prompted the statement.\" However, he did explain that he is more concerned about reports that Venezuela has relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the Bush administration than he is about Powell\\'s statement. He indicated: \"These reports have tried to suggest the existence of ties between Miraflores [Presidential Palace] and terrorist groups: There are documents presumably drafted by the FAN [National Armed Forces] expressing discontent with the government; the video disclosed by the journalists; and [Justice First Deputy] Gerardo Blyde\\'s remarks on the creation of militia groups trained by the guerrillas. All this has sounded the alarm for the US Executive and suits the opposition\\'s objectives to bring about an intervention or a blockade, which would hurt the people it claims to defend.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Oddly, he defended the content of the video by affirming - as the President did - that this is evidence of a humanitarian action. He argued: \"When the United States has faced a situation involving extremist groups holding hostages, they have sent intermediaries to negotiate and no one has said that this shows they have relations with those groups.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n [Caracas El Nacional (Internet version) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760-word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government\\'s tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell. The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell\\'s position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation: the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. Arzola stated: \"The government\\'s positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level, but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela, where the rule of law is under fire.\" Arzola added: Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela, especially a country that is Venezuela\\'s No.1 trade partner, must be heeded, as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation, which is demanding a rectification. The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin, who warned: \"When Chavez came to the Presidency, the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day. At present, because of the misguided policy of cutting production, we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels. If to this, we add the President\\'s constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing, but fulfill his political commitments, we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market.\" According to Fermin, the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence, there will be no investments. Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Julio Montoya stated: \"The national government has been extremely incompetent in handling relations with the United States. It has been vague about Venezuela\\'s intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism. Ambiguous situations constitute a breeding ground for bilateral tensions and the fact that currently, we do not even have an ambassador in Washington indicates that we are on the verge of a major breakdown in our relations with our leading trade partner.\"] \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020415/21.38.12-11637": {"extract": [{"text": "Criticisms of Chavez's governance have been widespread in

The conference in New York, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them. The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group. The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result, and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational. The Bonn Conference however, which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate, could be appraised as an exception and a relative success. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference, it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants, who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry. But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries; rather, the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America]. American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security. This is while possessing arms for self-defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity. Critics of the meeting, on the margin of the conference, up held the view that the American government, instead of heeding the wishes of international community, and protecting the security of world nations, and above all the safety of its own citizens, has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments. (It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [legal force] even for the participating countries.) [Sentences are as published] The most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in Genova; perhaps even more so for the results \"not obtained\" at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting. The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and ... [as published] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues, but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty. The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization, who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty. When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations, things got out of hand; the already volatile situation reached boiling point, violent clashes broke out, and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues. The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies, and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in New York and Bonn; whereas, from the onset, the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers. Because, from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization, the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too, neither Russia, China, Japan, nor even the European Union, had shown any enthusiasm; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project. Concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth\\'s climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] Bonn Conference, America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Whereas, beforehand, it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well. Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America, European Union, and Russia and China. And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict, and until the rivalry persists, the question would continue to remain unresolved. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n What, however, was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa, was the fact that most decisions made, were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [lobbies]. Here are the views expressed by two of the prominent characters attending the Genoa Conference. Jacques Chirac, the French President, responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization, had said: \"They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor...\" Similarly, Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true, legitimate, and elected representatives of the people of their countries. In the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide! [Exclamation mark as published] In view of the criticisms, which have been made, they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole \"world economy\" under their influence, and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n At the Bonn Conference too, the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind. The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment, and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ---, which has isolated America in an undeniable way. It was due to this isolation that America, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n To recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and ... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely. As regards the recent conference (Bonn Meeting), although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n ENDALL ARZK \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20010927/23.54.13-6261": {"extract": [{"text": "Authorities are only too aware that Kashgar is 4,000 kilometres (2,500

As this indicates, discussion on the \"axis of evil\" was the main purpose of the President\\'s visit to Japan. The prime minister announced his cooperation with the United States because he fully understands that \"the United States needs Japan\\'s cooperation,\" (said a senior Foreign Ministry official). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Saying that \"all options are on the table\" to deal with the \"axis of evil,\" the President also stated at the summit talks that he would \"seek a peaceful settlement.\" He explained a view aimed at solving the issue through diplomatic and other means for the time being. Ever since the President announced the \"axis of evil\" statement in January, Iran, Iraq, North Korea have been trying hard, out of the fear of possible confrontation with the United States, to deny their involvement in terrorism or proliferation of mass destruction weapons. \"The US strategy is beginning to work,\" (said a Foreign Ministry source). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n To tighten the noose around the \"axis of evil,\" the Japanese Government will seek understanding and cooperation from European countries that are critical of the President. At the same time, Japan also plans to \"work on Iran and North Korea through Japan\\'s own diplomatic channels for settlement of the issue,\" (according to a government source). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Since President Bush envisions using all options, however, we cannot deny the possibility that the United States may take military actions. The biggest concern in that case would be Japan\\'s military support system. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It seems that the government will enact the law for emergencies in an area surrounding Japan if the United States takes military actions against North Korea. But the reality is that \"there are many problems, including role sharing in joint actions with the US military, that we need to settle if we want to apply the law,\" (said a Defense Agency source). Also, there is a possibility of armed attacks on Japan. But improvement has not yet been made to the emergency legislation system. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In the case of military actions against Iran on the other hand, it also seems that \"judging from the lessons we learned from the Gulf War, Japan, which relies on the crude oil from the Middle East, cannot refuse offering cooperation,\" (said a Defense Agency source). There is a strong view among officials of the government and the ruling parties that application of the law for special measures to deal with terrorism would be difficult because this law is limited to dealing with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States only. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Moreover, Iraq is expected to fight back if it is attacked. This will lead us to the issue of exercising the right of collective self-defense. Therefore, the Japanese Government will be forced to introduce diverse legislation for the purpose of giving cooperation for US military actions. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"},

There were 1,200 soldiers aboard the ferry. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent Tamil Tiger suicide mission, Karunaratne said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The navy craft had approached the small boat thinking it was in distress as an elderly man, a teenager and another person onboard had put up a white flag. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As it neared the boat, it came under attack.

So he will be the second most qualified crew member on board, behind the on-board comander, who still needs to be appointed by the Russian space authorities. This appointment is not expected for a few weeks. So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship. This is a first on a \"TMA,\" which attests to the confidence the Russian and European partners have put in him. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n An example? In Brussels on Wednesday [28 November], the French astronaut Claudie Haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the Russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for De Winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in Moscow. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Frank worked at Star City with much intensity. In several weeks, he learned the indispensable bases of the Russian language. He is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences. His dynamism is an asset. People there are really unanimous about him,\" she told us. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"This assessment confirms us in our choices,\" a delighted Ylieff said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Some Particularly Financial Choices \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As is known, Frank De Winne\\'s taxi flight lasting about 10 days comes with a price tax: some 600 million [Belgian] francs (15.5 million euros). This is an amount that Belgian yesterday pledged to pay to Russia. An initial segment of 2.5 million euros (Frank\\'s training costs) will reportedly be paid in the next few days. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Several avenues have been explored to collect the overall amount. The latest, and also undoubtedly the most logical, is internal to the SSTC, the federal Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Services, which, in particular, manage the country\\'s space budgets. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The sum in question will come from the SSTC\\'s space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three). The SSTC\\'s overall budget will not suffer from this. Nor will the space sector\\'s in particular. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Cancellation Insurance \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Budgets will remain constant,\" explained Eric Beka, the SSTC\\'s secretary general. The sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission (and its many related scientific fall-outs) rather than to other optional programs. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In a word, De Winne\\'s ticket into space has been financed. And his \"parachute\" too. \"Since there is no other Belgian astronaut at the ESA who is capable of replacing Frank De Winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out, we are also expecting to take out \\'travel insurance\\' for our \\'cosmonaut,\\'\" Yvan Ylieff also said. \"This should insure that we can recover the sums involved, that in the prospect of another space trip.\" One million euros will be devoted to this \"cancellation\" insurance. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit. That was with the US Atlantis shuttle. In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut\\'s space suit. It will be a mission that will be rich in promises. De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting. He will become one of the best elements in the corps of European astronauts. In addition, he will carry the projects of Belgian scientists and industrialists active in the space sector far. As Picque emphasized, \"for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs.\" Who said that space investments were not interesting? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"},

"\\t\\nA detailed document has been issued after China's recent State of Council session [as published]. In the document serious criticism was made on the expanding military presence by the United States at the international level and it was demanded that the United States should stop the policy of dominating the world. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n After the 11 September suicide bomb attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the United States, instead of investigating the matter and coming up with proof, put all the blame for terrorism on Afghanistan. As a result, the United States formed a coalition with the aim of bringing an end to terrorism and the Taliban, due to which bombardment is still continuing in Afghanistan. In this operation, the manner in which defenseless, innocent and poor Muslims were blown up by ammunition is one of the most dreadful events in history. The whole world witnessed this loathsome action by the United States, but no one--including the Muslim community--raised a voice against this horrifying act of oppression. Encouraged by the global community's shameful silence, the United States has announced the second phase of its war against terrorism. By declaring Iraq, Iran and North Korea as 'axis of evil', the United States has announced to target these countries in the same manner as !\\nAfghanistan. North Korea has also been made the target due to the reason that according to the United States, it is being blamed for transferring nuclear technology and weapons to Islamic countries. The seven countries which the US terms as a threat to its security and against which it can use nuclear weapons, also include Russia and China. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The above-mentioned statement by China is the first ever by an important country after the 11 September events in the United States. In the document, the United States has been very openly told that it has become the number one country in damaging solidarity of other countries and violating human rights there. The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, on the start of his visit to Austria, protested against this dictatorial move by the United States. He also condemned the statement made by President Bush terming Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and that these countries are preparing weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Apparently President Bush's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche. This can be traced back to the events in 1818, when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks. Since then, the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living. The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to the analysis of Chomsky, after World War II, the US think tank had planned to subjugate a few regions of the world for its economic progress. The Middle East and many countries of the Third World were part of the plan. During the same period, anti-Soviet hysteria was also promoted strongly. The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice. As a result, the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963, Dominican Republic in 1984, Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950, that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost. It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic, was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it. It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is due to this hegemony, which the United States wants to maintain, that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world. The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment. After the 11 September events, the United States completely ignored the international convention of human rights and by doing so negated its own constitution. After the events in Washington and New York, approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail, and one person, Mohammed Butt, died of heart failure during detention. No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves. Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba. These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there. As a lesson to others!\\n, various American TV channels, daily, show shots of the conditions under which these prisoners are being kept. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Above all, the US media has reported that the involvement of Jews in the 11 September events cannot be ruled out. The media also reported that 120 Israeli spies were arrested and were exiled from the United States on the orders of the Department of Justice. This not only shows the double standards of the US but also its selfishness. This also exposes the background of keeping the US troops and military basis in different parts of the world. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Therefore, China is justified in demanding that the United States, by creating conflicts and by embarking upon the policy of oppression and supremacy should stop interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights. According to China, the American society is engulfed by violence and crime. Racial prejudice has assumed alarming proportions. There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This report [above-mentioned document by China] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective. Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard. The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001--the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States. Pakistan has not only earned a bad name but also its internal and external problems have increased manifold. Pakistan should draw its own conclusions in the light of its own circumstances, from this report issued by China. Instead of blindly accepting every demand made by the United States and responding positively to every American phone call, Pakistan should take every single step carefully. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020510/21.56.20-863": {"extract": [{"text": "He said Somali nationals in Kuwait and Bahrain had expressed their satisfaction and support for the interim Somali government.", "question": "the interim Somali government", "answer": ["w", "Prime Minister Hasan Abshir Farah", "Somali nationals in Kuwait and Bahrain"]}], "context": "\\t\\nPrime Minister Hasan Abshir Farah returned to Mogadishu today [9 May], after having been away for a month to receive medical treatment.

Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n During the 2000 parliamentary elections, 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Instead, an Australian member of the Federal Parliament, Julie Bishop, vented her anger towards the President and Government, and the electoral process, in Australia\\'s media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions. Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers? Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of \"consensus\", she and others of a similar view were dismissed as \"troublemakers\" by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday\\'s inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country\\'s decision to condemn Zimbabwe\\'s presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n And close by, Howard will have the British government and the western media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n And, in line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n No doubt Blair will fight on. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa, not with the people of Britain and Europe.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020409/22.17.52-18926": {"extract": [{"text": "Local dailies quoted senior Commerce Ministry official Boontipa Simaskul as saying that if China agrees to form a bilateral

his re-election victory, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was sworn in on Sunday as the country\\'s head of state to serve another six-year term. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n With a 21-gun salute sounding and four fighter jets sweeping overhead, the colorful inauguration took place amid thunderous applause by thousands of ruling party supporters. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku presided over the swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed by leaders of some other African countries, including Malawian President Bakili Muluzi, Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Democratic Republic of the Congo President Joseph Kabila, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mukapa, South African Vice-President Jacob Zuma, Zambian Vice-President Enock Kavendele. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Zimbabwe\\'s top judge, who was dressing in British-style scarlet and black robes and shoulder-length horsehair judicial wigs, bedecked Mugabe with a red sash of office. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe do swear that I will be faithful to the laws of the Republic of Zimbabwe, so help me God,\" said Mugabe who was flanked by first lady Grace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Mugabe, who is from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), won last weekend\\'s presidential election by polling 1,685,212 against his closest rival Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) who polled 1,262,401 votes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n At the State House, where the ceremony was held, thousands of ZANU-PF supporters in clothing emblazoned with

minority. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his inauguration speech shortly after he was sworn in as president, Mugabe vowed to continue with his government\\'s controversial land reform program. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He told thousands of cheering supporters that \"land reforms must proceed with greater speed and strength\" to shore up the economy, badly battered by years of political instability. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of Zimbabwe\\'s arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy, and we will do that through the land reforms,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In the run-up to the March 9-11 poll, critics had accused the Zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country\\'s closest-fought election since independence in 1980. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But he told the nation that in spite of stiff opposition to the agrarian reforms from powerful Western countries, especially the country\\'s former colonial power

The panel was scheduled to meet in London on Tuesday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow Britain and the United States to save face over their insistence on the MDC\\' s victory in Zimbabwe\\'s election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The European Union (EU) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A final communique issued on Saturday evening after the Barcelona EU summit said, \"The European Union will maintain its humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe and will consider possible additional targeted measures against its government.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Sunday\\'s inauguration ceremony was boycotted by EU countries, the US and some members of the Commonwealth. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Also, the opposition\\'s 57 members of parliament stayed away. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his inaugural address, Mugabe extended an olive branch to the opposition to join him in rebuilding the country\\'s economy, which has suffered three years of consecutive decline, but did not say in what role. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Our energy is better spent on reviving the economy than plotting to bring down each other,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The call to all of us, whether in the ruling party or in the opposition, is that we unite and come together as one people.

But, he added that the Qatari government had neither sought nor was given any commitment by Greenpeace not to undertake demonstrations. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n We discussed a number of conditions for the boat to be allowed to moor here and we have fulfilled all those conditions, the environmentalist told reporters on board the ship at the Doha harbour, before setting sail towards Doha Sheraton, the conference venue. So, we will act very responsibly and I have given all guarantees to Sheikh (Hamad bin Faisal) al-Thani (chairman of the organising committee) that we would be responsible, peaceful and that we would act in a very constructive manner with them. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But, he added that the Greenpeace is here to voice the concerns of millions of people. We are going to give a voice to people that you dont want to hear. And thats the meaning of the Rainbow Warrior being here. And the people who are here are going to voice their concerns and voice their demands. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Parmentier said they would use every possible peaceful means at our disposal to make sure that the voice of the people is heard. He pointed out that Qatar, while presenting Dohas candidature to host the meeting, had made an official commitment that it would allow peaceful protests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Earlier, the Rainbow Warrior sailed into Doha on Thursday morning, to challenge the WTO to use the 4th ministerial conference to force the United States to commit to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Talking to the press, Greenpeace executive director Gerd Leipold said currently the most important issue is climate change. If we continue to burn fossil fuel at the rate we are going today, we look at a bleak future. Islands will go under, nations will vanish from the face of earth and millions of people will have to leave their homes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The environmental organisation warned the delegates at the conference that the principles of the WTO would be rendered worthless unless the meeting extracted the commitment from the US on Kyoto Protocol. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The US produces 25% of world green house gases but has only 4% of the population of the world. It just cannot be that one country reaps all the benefits of mock globalisation but does not take any responsibility for the biggest global problem we are facing today. This is fundamentally unfair and unjust, Leipold said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Parmentier said, on the one hand, the WTO claims to support sustainable development and environmental protection and on the other, it does virtually nothing to protect the environment. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Kyoto Protocol rejection by the US is in effect a hidden subsidy. This is a breach of the very constitution of WTO. The WTO claims that it wants to protect the environment. Then today, in Doha, they must condemn the US for allowing a hidden subsidy, which according to the US governments own figures is equivalent to between $76.7bn and $300bn by 2010. This is the first test case for WTO. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Parmentier urged the delegates not to even discuss the possibility of a new round of trade negotiations unless the US this week in Doha ratifies the Kyoto Protocol. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said Greenpeace looked forward to work in partnership with developing countries to get the proper assessment of the impact of the WTO instead of a new round of trade negotiations. In 1993, when the WTO was created everybody jumped without checking whether there was a proper safety net at the bottom. What we are saying is, lets not jump again too quickly and lets check if there is a safety net. And lets consolidate those safety nets before we jump into a new round. This is the only responsible course of action and it will be a historic success for Doha and we want this meeting to be a success. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n If in six days time there has been no new round, this meeting will have been a success, because it will force the WTO to change, he said. WTO decisions must not be allowed to overrule international environmental agreements; the precautionary principle must be incorporated in decision-making, and patents on life must be banned, Parmentier added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On board the Rainbow Warrior are nationalities from 18 countries, including witnesses from local communities who will testify to the adverse effects of WTO global policies. The organisation will also be broadcasting No New Round Radio daily over the Internet. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Parmentier hoped the Qatari authorities would honour their commitment to allow free access to the people of the country to the ship and vice versa. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Answering another question, he said the WTO came to Qatar to hide from protestors.

a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone\\'s throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The memory Russia\\'s Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of. Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth\\'s atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia. Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth. Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia\\'s national sovereignty. At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO). [passage omitted on technical details of operation of GSO] \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota. But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator. Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia\\'s objections. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n International law governing accountability if one nation\\'s space debris falls on another is already in existence. The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth\\'s atmosphere. The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states\\' space projects. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14. This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one\\'s hands. Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention. This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory. Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle. This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim. It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim. In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station. This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia\\'s few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion. Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said. It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities. If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator. This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases,\" Priyatna said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter. In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications. This is a very important lesson for Indonesia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]. \"In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn\\'t go against the current. Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour\\'s space activities. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities. The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes,\" Priyatna said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour. \"Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre. Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967. Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn\\'t it be better to join them in our own national interest?\" he asked. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception.

But neither Itamaraty nor the Planalto Palace confirmed the president\\'s phone call to the governor of Cordoba. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators. Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena, to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina. Deputy Jose Genoino (Workers Party -- Sao Paulo) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy. He asked that Brazil promote meetings in the South American continent, or serve as intermediary in negotiations with international institutions. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"This is an unpredictable, anarchical situation. We don\\'t know where it will go, against whom. It is dangerous! In addition to Argentina there are other countries in crisis, such as Colombia and Venezuela. We have a very risky scenario. Any step backward for democracy on the continent would be a disaster. Brazil cannot stand by with its hands folded just watching all of this,\" Genoino affirmed. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Jose Anibal (Sao Paulo) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions. He noted, \"Brazil should adopt an open posture with relation to Argentina, which is experiencing a tragedy.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For Jose Agripino Maia, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Senate, although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The political warning must be heeded. Either one pays attention to the will of the people or what happened will happen.\" Maia commented. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Senator Heloisa Helena (Workers Party -- Alagoas) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: \"Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy. I hope that this can alert the Brazilian Government to revise its relationship with the IMF.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Analysts: Lack of Alternative for Power \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Political scientists agree: Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism. This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country. USP [University of Sao Paulo] professor Emir Sader believes that Peronists will remain in power after the elections, slowly growing weaker, allowing room for the emergence of new leadership. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The degree of pauperization will be brutal. Everything depends on how long it takes for Peronism to burn out and new leadership to emerge,\" Sader said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n For the political scientist, Argentina cannot wait for assistance from the American Government. Latin America is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Sader affirmed, \"The new policy of (US President George W.) Bush is to permit decay. The concern now is security. All eyes are on Pakistan, China, and Russia.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020430/22.09.32-24118": {"extract": [{"text": "During his visits to some OPEC member states in 2000, he also paid a

4th, 2002 -- Thirty-two non-governmental organisations [NGOs] today said they have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission or Suhakam for 100 days since April 24 - when the latest appointments to the commission took effect. Speaking on behalf of the NGOs , human rights organisation, Hakam president Ramdas Tikamdas said the boycott was to protest the government\\'s poor response to Suhakam\\'s numerous recommendations thus far. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The NGOs note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored Suhakam\\'s maiden report and its freedom of assembly report. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Whereas the Kesas report, submitted after a public inquiry, earned the disdain and wrath of the Prime Minister (Dr Mahathir Mohamad) who summarily dismissed it as a product of `western biased\\',\" he said during a press conference at the Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall in Kuala Lumpur. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Kesas report irked Mahathir after it found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering along the Kesas highway on Nov 5, 2000. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The NGOs stressed the government has also failed to respect or recognise Suhakam\\'s recommendations and also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Ramdas said the government\\'s failure to adhere to the commission\\'s recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but \"a mere public relations tool\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Over the last two years, the state of human rights in Malaysia has deteriorated with increasing numbers of people detained without trial under the Internal Security Act, with blanket police ban on assemblies, with restrictions to the right of free speech and expression and with further restrictive amendments to the election laws, all of which have further denied our democratic space,\" he added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The NGOs also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights, namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant Against Torture. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Controversial appointments \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Meanwhile, another concern raised was Suhakam\\'s independence following the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, Anuar Zainal Abidin, Prof Mehrun Siraj and Dr Salleh Mohd Nor. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Ramdas said it was perceived that Anuar and Mehrun, instrumental behind the scathing Kesas report, were dropped for performing their duties without fear or favour. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The fact that three commissioners have now been axed is a clear signal to other commissioners that their tenure is dependent on whether or not they have pleased the executive. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"This clearly undermines the independence of the Commission and will erode public\\'s confidence on it.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On the other hand, the NGOs said there is nothing in the public records which shows that Abu Talib was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Claiming that there was \"nothing personal\", the NGOs said their concern was based on his defense of the 1987 \\'Ops Lalang\\' where more than 100 people were detained under the ISA [Internal Security Act]. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n They added that Abu Talib, during his tenure as AG [attorney general], was also instrumental for the impeachment of then Lord President Salleh Abas and five Supreme Court judges in 1988. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners which has led to Suhakam being made up mostly of retired civil servants. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The new commissioners are retired Treasury deputy secretary-general Ramon Navaratnam, permanent representative to the United Nations Hasmy Agam, Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (Ikim) director-general Dr Abdul Monir Yaacob, retired Education director-general Asiah Abu Samah and retired National Population and Family Development Board director-general Dr Raj Abdul Karim. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Our concern is whether persons used to the role of policy implementors can objectively assess and critique executive policies which impinge on human rights,\" said Ramdas. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Elaborating further on the boycott, Ramdas said the NGOs will not hold any dialogues, send any memorandums or complaints to Suhakam. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"In the meantime, we will monitor the commissioners in the discharge of their statutory duties in respect of the pending complaints and inquires,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We will also note to what extent Suhakam will monitor the government\\'s compliance with previous recommendations on various human rights issues contained in its maiden report to the Parliament as well as its other reports,\" he added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Ramdas said Suhakam\\'s performance will be judged not on the number of statements issued or reports produced but on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"When the bill (Suhakam Act ) was tabled in the parliament, our Foreign Affairs Minister (Syed Hamid Albar) promised that this would be a positive development in protecting and promoting human rights in Malaysia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We are now looking at Suhakam as an institution to fulfill this promise,\" he stressed. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to Ramdas the NGOs will meet again after the 100-day period to review their position. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Apart from Hakam, other notable NGOs involved in the boycott are the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), Suaram, Amesty International\\'s Malaysian chapter, Jamaah Islah Malaysia (Jim) and Sisters in Islam (SIS). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Boycott unfair \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In a related development, Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan told malaysiakini that he was disappointed with the boycott which he described as \"unfair\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Instead of resorting to such measures, the commissioner said the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights in this country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He added the boycott could create the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self interest and are not honest about championing human rights. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"This action shows that the NGOs themselves do not acknowledge Suhakam and do not want to work with us,\" said Hamdan.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011014/22.00.23-1236": {"extract": [{"text": "The PRL [Liberal Reform Party] and the PSC [Christian Social Party] opposition party continue to support the strikes

Finally and most importantly, Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized. Africa, with its own \"observers,\" has just ratified a shameful electoral sham. Kenya and Tanzania even \"congratulated\" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about \"good governance\" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on \"sustainable development\" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Fortunately, Europe is no longer \"Africa\\'s policeman.\" But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011108/21.45.03-5180": {"extract": [{"text": "It is also working to push the Palestinians and the world into new

Cook signalled tonight. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz.

become totally dependent on mainland China within the next few years, causing the island to lose control of its own political fate, a French weekly warned Thursday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Nouvel Observateur said that Beijing is unlikely to annex Taiwan by force, despite its deployment of missiles along its coastal provinces opposite Taiwan, but is instead resorting to smarter tactics, bringing the Taiwan authorities to heel through Taiwan businessmen who are eager to explore the mainland Chinese market. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The weekly said that mainland China has attracted more than US$50 billion in investment from Taiwan thus far, while the Taipei authorities bowed to pressure from its own businessmen to lift restrictions on investment in mainland China in May, a move expected to speed up the flow of Taiwan capital to its arch rival. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Barring any reversal to the trend, the weekly quoted U.S. magazine Business Weekly as saying that Beijing might bring the island to its knees without firing one bullet. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Another factor which might deter Beijing\\'s military adventurism in the Taiwan Strait is Washington\\'s \"readiness to fight Beijing for Taiwan,\" which will bear witness to Washington\\'s determination to remain a power in Asia, according to the magazine. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The publication quoted Wu Guoguang, a professor at Hong Kong University, as saying that any concessions by Washington on the Taiwan issue could trigger a defection of its Asian allies, including Japan, to Beijing\\'s fold. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But Beijing\\'s leaders are not likely to blink on the issue either because an independent state in Taiwan would boost the schisms in Tibet and Xinjiang and threaten the regime in Beijing, the magazine claimed. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Although there is only scant possibility of a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the Nouvel Observateur said, Beijing\\'s military buildup in its southern coastal provinces still makes the region \"the most heavily armed place in the world next only to the Middle East,\" and a dangerous flashpoint in the 21st century.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020119/21.10.42-27754": {"extract":

profound economic crisis in Argentina has coincided with a wave of social tension during recent days. Riots and widespread strikes, attacks on government buildings, and the plundering of stores have left scores of dead and casualties. Public dissatisfaction and an increase in the people's anger in this country have finally resulted in the collapse of Fernando Delaroe's government following several days of protest. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Because of the misguided policies of Argentina's politicians, Argentina is in a state of stagnation for a fourth consecutive years. The unemployment rate has passed 18 percent and the hard currency is continuously being devalued. Foreign debts are around $132 billion and poverty is dominating the country like a dangerous virus. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies. The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts. Incidentally, the riots also occurred following the IMF's announcement of Argentina's debts. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy. Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy. This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe. Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina. Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In the heat of crisis, the interim government has introduced new initiatives. Among them are halting the payment of debts and the execution of supportive actions for the poor people, controlling government and state expenses, attempts to increase employment, giving food help and trying to take out new loans, and the adoption of new monetary policies. However, there are a few ambiguous points, such as: \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 1 -- What amount of Argentina's economic crisis is due to its relations with the global economy and how much effect will it have on the European and US economies due to its present stagnation? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 2 -- What reaction is likely from other countries and international institutions to the government's new policies, for instance halting the payment of debts? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 3 -- Finally, what fate awaits Argentina's crisis-stricken economy? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20010818/01.09.50-14694": {"extract": [{"text": "\"Until such time as Mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option.", "question": "international sanctions", "answer": ["w", "Mr Morgan Tsvangirai"]}, {"text": "MDC leader Tsvangirai at it again in South Africa", "question": "MDC leader Tsvangirai", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake.", "question": "full economic sanctions", "answer": ["w", "Mr Morgan Tsvangirai"]}, {"text": "Mr Tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act for allegedly threatening to violently remove President Mugabe from power last year.", "question": "violently remove President Mugabe from power last year", "answer": ["w", "Mr Morgan Tsvangirai"]}, {"text": "But analysts expressed concern that the MDC leader is \"flirting with mercenaries in South Africa\".", "question": "the MDC leader is \"flirting with mercenaries in South Africa", "answer": ["w", "analysts"]}, {"text": "Mr Tsvangirai called for international action to ensure a free and fair presidential election.", "question": "international action to ensure a free and fair presidential election", "answer": ["w", "Mr Morgan Tsvangirai"]}, {"text": "If you don\\'t want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently.\"", "question": "you", "answer": ["w", "Mr Morgan Tsvangirai", "MDC"]}, {"text": "If the Supreme Court rules in favour of Mr Tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the Attorney General's Office will have to draw up a new charge.", "question": "Mr Tsvangirai", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Zimbabwe's performance in Mozambique, Somalia and the DRC speaks for itself.", "question": "Zimbabwe's performance in Mozambique, Somalia and the DRC", "answer": ["w", "analysts"]}, {"text": "\"However, we do support certain limitations on the villains of the crisis in Zimbabwe,\" he said.", "question": "certain limitations on the villains of the crisis in Zimbabwe", "answer": ["w", "Mr Morgan Tsvangirai", "MDC"]}, {"text": "Charges against the MDC leader arose after he allegedly told a crowd at the party\\'s first anniversary last year that \"...
