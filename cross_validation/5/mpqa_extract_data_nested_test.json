Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran. Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington\\'s biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic. The UN rapporteur\\'s new report on Iran, which he submitted to the commission on Friday, includes nothing new. In most cases he described the legal punishments like floggings and executions of murderers and major drug traffickers that are applied based on the Shria, or Islamic law as human rights violations. In other cases, he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities. He made such charges despite the fact that women\\'s political, social and cultural participation is not less than that of men. Women in Iran hold managerial, academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet. And as far as minorities are concerned, they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority, as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely. In his report, the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran\\'s internal affairs. For instance, he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran, while the measure has been taken in line with the law. He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations! This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials. Interestingly, although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996, he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic. This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime. Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"},

Journalists Ibeyise Pacheco, Marta Colomina, Patricia Poleo, and Marianela Salazar disclosed this video in recent days. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The deputy said that Powell\\'s remarks did not surprise him and added that the US official\\'s opinion is based on reports published by the domestic and international press, which is waging a ruthless war against the Venezuelan chief of state. He noted: \"The opposition is succeeding at portraying an image of Venezuela that scares away investors and triggers domestic turmoil to request the intervention of foreign powers in the country.\" Thus, Carreno excused the White House official, whom - he argued - was misled by the smear campaign and information sabotage that has been unleashed against Chavez in the country and abroad. He took one further step and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see what is really happening. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He accused the four journalists of plotting with powerful economic groups that presumably contributed the funds to purchase the video from an intelligence agent. He stressed that these journalists should be tried since, according to Article 122 of the Penal Code, any action that instigates interventionist actions is considered treason against the homeland. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Carreno said: \"This is what they are trying to accomplish through this campaign and their conduct, which is not that of journalists but of opposition activists, prompted the statement.\" However, he did explain that he is more concerned about reports that Venezuela has relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the Bush administration than he is about Powell\\'s statement. He indicated: \"These reports have tried to suggest the existence of ties between Miraflores [Presidential Palace] and terrorist groups: There are documents presumably drafted by the FAN [National Armed Forces] expressing discontent with the government; the video disclosed by the journalists; and [Justice First Deputy] Gerardo Blyde\\'s remarks on the creation of militia groups trained by the guerrillas. All this has sounded the alarm for the US Executive and suits the opposition\\'s objectives to bring about an intervention or a blockade, which would hurt the people it claims to defend.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Oddly, he defended the content of the video by affirming - as the President did - that this is evidence of a humanitarian action. He argued: \"When the United States has faced a situation involving extremist groups holding hostages, they have sent intermediaries to negotiate and no one has said that this shows they have relations with those groups.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n [Caracas El Nacional (Internet version) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760-word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government\\'s tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell. The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell\\'s position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation: the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. Arzola stated: \"The government\\'s positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level, but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela, where the rule of law is under fire.\" Arzola added: Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela, especially a country that is Venezuela\\'s No.1 trade partner, must be heeded, as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation, which is demanding a rectification. The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin, who warned: \"When Chavez came to the Presidency, the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day. At present, because of the misguided policy of cutting production, we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels. If to this, we add the President\\'s constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing, but fulfill his political commitments, we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market.\" According to Fermin, the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence, there will be no investments. Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Julio Montoya stated: \"The national government has been extremely incompetent in handling relations with the United States. It has been vague about Venezuela\\'s intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism. Ambiguous situations constitute a breeding ground for bilateral tensions and the fact that currently, we do not even have an ambassador in Washington indicates that we are on the verge of a major breakdown in our relations with our leading trade partner.\"] \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011129/21.35.18-3709": {"extract": [{"text": "The current summit will hopefully allow the CIS countries to lay new ways towards rapprochement.", "question": "The current summit", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Moscow, 29 November: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has arrived in Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said upon his arrival on Thursday [29 November] that \"certain apathy\" to the commonwealth has developed in the CIS member countries.", "question": "the commonwealth", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev", "the CIS member countries"]}, {"text": "Moscow, 29 November: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has arrived in Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said upon his arrival on Thursday [29 November] that \"certain apathy\" to the commonwealth has developed in the CIS member countries.", "question": "the CIS member countries", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}, {"text": "Making his point clear, he said that the former Soviet republics \"have not completely fallen apart, but have not formed a sufficiently strong alliance on a new basis either\".", "question": "the former Soviet republics", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}, {"text": "Concerning the delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and Russia, Nazarbayev said that this process is continuing without any disagreements and with mutual respect for each other's interests, and that documents on the final delimitation are likely to be signed next year.", "question": "this process", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}, {"text": "Concerning the delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and Russia, Nazarbayev said that this process is continuing without any disagreements and with mutual respect for each other's interests, and that documents on the final delimitation are likely to be signed next year.", "question": "each other's interests", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev", "Kazakhstan and Russia"]}, {"text": "He said this tendency reflects the economic and cultural traditions of the CIS countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union.", "question": "this tendency", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}, {"text": "He said, however, that a real unification will take place after all, since the CIS countries have far more reasons for a union that the European Union countries.", "question": "unification", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}, {"text": "Kazakh president optimistic about future of CIS", "question": "future of CIS", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}, {"text": "\"We cannot stand on the sidelines of this global tendency,\" the Kazakh president said.", "question": "We", "answer": ["w", "Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev"]}], "context": "\\t\\nKazakh president optimistic about future of CIS \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Moscow, 29 November: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has arrived in Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said upon his arrival on Thursday [29 November] that \"certain apathy\" to the commonwealth has developed in the CIS member countries.

to stay in power by every possible means. The electoral hijacking had been announced, prepared, and organized. It has now taken place. Should one be surprised? Since he nearly lost his parliamentary majority in June 2000, the head of state has stated and restated to his supporters that the presidential election was going to be a \"war.\" He was as good as his word. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The \"war for land\" continued, at the risk of causing famine. The army swore allegiance to the \"father of independence,\" regardless of the verdict at the ballot box. The independence of Zimbabwe\\'s justice system was compromised. The local press was harassed. The opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) was the victim of \"state terrorism\" that its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai rightly condemned after being beaten in an election loaded against him from start to finish, from drawing up the electoral lists to counting the votes. The real secret of the ballot box will never be revealed. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This \"fait accompli\" in Zimbabwe is a challenge for the international community. It can only rise to meet it by making some radical changes. Indignant protests apart, nothing was done to prevent the disaster awaiting one of the key countries in southern Africa, seen as the continent\\'s growth pole. The weapon of so-called \"intelligent\" sanctions proved ineffective, especially as the punitive measures were taken too late and only served to deny Robert Mugabe and his associates trips abroad and access to the funds they have spirited away. They amounted to no more than a ban on holidays and a golden retirement. Finally and most importantly, Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized. Africa, with its own \"observers,\" has just ratified a shameful electoral sham. Kenya and Tanzania even \"congratulated\" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about \"good governance\" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on \"sustainable development\" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Fortunately, Europe is no longer \"Africa\\'s policeman.\" But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011214/20.26.01-7285": {"extract": [{"text": "President Pervez Musharraf will pay a state visit to China from 20th to 24th of this month at the invitation of the president of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin.", "question": "President Pervez Musharraf will pay a state visit to China", "answer": ["w", "Mr. Jiang Zemin"]}, {"text": "Bilateral agreements regarding the Saindak copper and gold projects, Thar coal mines development, technical and economic cooperation, and a joint revolving fund for scientific research, and other hydroelectric projects are likely to be signed during the visit.", "question": "Bilateral agreements regarding the Saindak copper and gold projects, Thar coal mines development, technical and economic cooperation, and a joint revolving fund for scientific research, and other hydroelectric projects", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "Over the years, China has emerged as a key economic partner and an important source of external assistance for Pakistan.", "question": "China", "answer": ["w"]}], "context": "\\t\\nPresident Pervez Musharraf will pay a state visit to China from 20th to 24th of this month at the invitation of the president of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin.

Bush said Monday that all options were on the table to deal with Iraq, Iran and North Korea, even as Germany warned against any \"adventure\" in Iraq. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n At the start of his Asian tour, Bush dismissed a chilly reception by US allies to his \"axis of evil\" rhetoric, telling reporters in Tokyo, \"I will keep all options on the table. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We want to resolve all issues peacefully, whether it be Iraq, Iran or North Korea,\" Bush said, speaking next to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Bush has lumped those three countries together in what terms an \"axis of evil,\" in language that has riled US allies. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The president renewed his pledge to thwart terrorist groups who want to \"mate up\" with regimes hoping to acquire weapons of mass destruction and said \"nations will come with us\" if the US-led war on terrorism is extended. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"People who love freedom understand that we cannot allow nations that aren\\'t transparent, nations with a terrible history, nations that are so dictatorial they\\'re willing to starve their people, we can\\'t allow them to mate up with terrorist organizations,\" Bush said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Asked about French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine\\'s criticism of the \"axis\" concept as \"simplistic,\" Bush said: \"I understand what happens in the international arena; people say things. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"But the leaders I\\'ve talked to understand, exactly, what needs to happen. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"They understand that our commitment is not just in Afghanistan, that history has given us a unique opportunity to defend freedom,\" he added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Bush, who arrived in Tokyo Sunday at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Seoul and Beijing, held talks with Koizumi on the war effort in Afghanistan. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But the leaders did not \"specifically\" talk about military action against any other country, a senior US administration official said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Bush is due to travel to Seoul Tuesday and the following day will visit the heavily fortified no-man\\'s land between South Korea and communist North Korea. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The United States maintains some 37,000 troops on the Korean peninsula, and Bush has called the de-militarised zone dividing South Korea from its hardline communist northern neighbour \"one of the most dangerous places on earth\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But his tough stand on P\\'yongyang has provoked concern in Seoul, where President Kim Tae-chung, who is in the last year of his five-year term, has been trying to prise the hermit state out of isolation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n South Korean ministers fear Bush\\'s tough talking may put back by years Kim\\'s so-called Sunshine Policy of establishing a permanent peace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Angry anti-US protests erupted in Seoul ahead of Bush\\'s arrival with police storming the American Chamber of Commerce and detaining 32 students occupying the building. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n During the three-hour occupation, protesters hurled leaflets proclaiming Bush to be a \"war freak\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n US diplomats say Bush will seek to support Kim\\'s Nobel Prize winning policy by offering new talks with the North, while remaining firm about North Korea\\'s missile sales and its feared chemical and biological weapons programmes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n North Korea remains unconvinced, calling Bush the head of \"an empire of evil.\" Its state media said last week that Bush \"is the most bellicose and heinous\" US president, and added his visit was only intended to \"fan up war hysteria\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Even though US officials have stressed that no firm military plans exist for expanding the war on terror launched after the September 11 attacks, they said late Sunday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should go. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We\\'ve made no secret of the fact that we think that the world will be much safer when the Iraqi people have a regime that they deserve instead of the regime that they have,\" National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told CBS television. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Washington has long accused Baghdad, under UN sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, of developing weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But Baghdad insisted Sunday it could not be a threat to the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"It is the United States that is threatening Iraq and not the contrary. They are the ones attacking Iraq, not the other way round,\" said Ath-Thawra, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party in Baghdad. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Even if Iraq possessed such weapons, it could not threaten the United States. How could it threaten a country that possesses weapons of mass destruction that could destroy entire planets?\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In Berlin, Germany\\'s chief government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye told journalists, \"The federal government cannot imagine that the United States government has an interest in engaging in an adventure\" in Iraq. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pledged \"undivided support\" for the fight against terrorism a week after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, saying, \"Germany is ready for risks, including military ones, but not for adventures.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He had also insisted on the right of the allies to be informed and consulted about US plans. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The German government spokesman said it would be \"useful\" if UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer last week sharply criticised Bush\\'s \"axis of evil\" remarks, telling a newspaper that such a concept \"gets us nowhere.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Iran, which has long had tense relations with its western neighbor, voiced opposition to a new US strike against Iraq. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We hope that the issue would be solved through peaceful means, with initiatives from the UN secretary general and a more active role by the UN,\" Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi told a news conference. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We also hope that Iraq gives a favourable response and allows UN weapon inspectors\" to return to the country, he added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Kharazi said that some 150 foreigners arrested recently on Iran\\'s border with Pakistan were not members of the al-Qaeda terror network, but admitted some could be sympathisers and would be sent back to their home countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Among those being held were 40 women, between 70 and 80 children and a number of men of European, North African and Middle East origin, including a handful of Afghans. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A diplomatic source said the affair could become \"embarrassing\" for European countries, \"because of the insistence of the Americans on judging for themselves\" those who supported al-Qaeda. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al-Qa\\'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran, which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would act if provided with evidence. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In another verbal attack Kharazi accused the United States of wanting to exercise \"world dictatorship\" since the \"horrible attacks\" of September 11. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"America\\'s rulers have proved that they cannot be trusted,\" he said. \"They are seeking unilaterally to become the masters of the world and want to sweep aside all competitors from other countries.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Afghan interim Interior Minister Yunus Qanooni told AFP that two suspects in last week\\'s murder of aviation and tourism minister Abdul Rahman had been arrested in Saudi Arabia and could be sent back to Afghanistan. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011211/20.47.43-22487": {"extract": [{"text": "The financial impact of operations in Afghanistan, which are expected to mobilize some 5,000 men, will not take effect until 2002.", "question": "operations in Afghanistan", "answer": ["w"]}], "context": "\\t\\nParis -- The French Armed Forces' operations abroad in 2001 will have entailed an overspend of 3.290 billion Francs [Fr].
