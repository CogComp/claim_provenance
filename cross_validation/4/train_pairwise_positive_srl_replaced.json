At the rate syndicates are abducting targets--regardless of their ethnic identity and their diplomatic status--with impunity, the administration faces a more serious and direct challenge to its capacity to govern from the specter of lawlessness than from the daunting problem of sparking an economic recovery amid the global economic downturn.

In terms of the amount of emissions, South Korea discharged 410 million tons of carbon dioxide in 1999, ranking tenth in the world.
