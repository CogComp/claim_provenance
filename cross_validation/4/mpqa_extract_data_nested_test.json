rights after 50 years of bitter experience and the heavy losses that the humanity has suffered. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The statement said that several hundred documents have been signed to promote human rights and different cultures have put forward their outlooks about human rights and envisaged measures to stop violation of human rights. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The IHRC called for prohibition of

have not been materialized. \"The human communities have suffered heavy human losses in the course of devastating world wars and understood that any progress in human communities is dependent on honoring the human rights,\" it said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The IHRC said that the international conference against racism in Durban, South Africa August 31-September 7, 2001 was a turning point in the international campaign to honor human rights. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The statement deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, the religious minorities, the children and women in some parts of the world. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The IHRC said that all nations and religions condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.

Riots and widespread strikes, attacks on government buildings, and the plundering of stores have left scores of dead and casualties. Public dissatisfaction and an increase in the people's anger in this country have finally resulted in the collapse of Fernando Delaroe's government following several days of protest. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Because of the misguided policies of Argentina's politicians, Argentina is in a state of stagnation for a fourth consecutive years. The unemployment rate has passed 18 percent and the hard currency is continuously being devalued. Foreign debts are around $132 billion and poverty is dominating the country like a dangerous virus. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies. The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts. Incidentally, the riots also occurred following the IMF's announcement of Argentina's debts. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy. Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy. This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe. Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina. Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In the heat of crisis, the interim government has introduced new initiatives. Among them are halting the payment of debts and the execution of supportive actions for the poor people, controlling government and state expenses, attempts to increase employment, giving food help and trying to take out new loans, and the adoption of new monetary policies. However, there are a few ambiguous points, such as: \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 1 -- What amount of Argentina's economic crisis is due to its relations with the global economy and how much effect will it have on the European and US economies due to its present stagnation? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 2 -- What reaction is likely from other countries and international institutions to the government's new policies, for instance halting the payment of debts? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 3 -- Finally, what fate awaits Argentina's crisis-stricken economy? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020523/22.37.46-10374": {"extract": [{"text": "It added that there is \\ngrowing public interest in space tourism around the world, and \\nthat it is now seen as a vehicle for increasing personal \\npopularity.", "question": "it", "answer": ["w", "the Russian Aerospace Agency"]}, {"text": "It added that there is \\ngrowing public interest in space tourism around the world, and \\nthat it is now seen as a vehicle for increasing personal \\npopularity.", "question": "space tourism", "answer": ["w", "the Russian Aerospace Agency", "public"]}, {"text": "In the \\nmeantime, two Americans, a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance \\nBass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver, are \\ncompleting medical examinations at the Institute for Biomedical \\nProblems in Moscow to be okayed for a flight.", "question": "two Americans, a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance \\nBass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver", "answer": ["w", "the Institute for Biomedical \\nProblems"]}, {"text": "At a joint news \\nconference in Moscow this month, Interfax was told that both \\nAmericans are expected to announce intentions to fly to space.", "question": "both \\nAmericans", "answer": ["w"]}, {"text": "At a joint news \\nconference in Moscow this month, Interfax was told that both \\nAmericans are expected to announce intentions to fly to space.", "question": "fly to space", "answer": ["w", "a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance \\nBass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver", "a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance \\nBass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver"]}], "context": "Reference: CEP20020523000297 Moscow Interfax in English 1517 GMT 23 May 02\\n\\n\\t\\tINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC\\n\\t\\tINTERNATIONAL POLITICAL\\n\\t\\tTECHNOLOGY\\n\\n\\t MOSCOW.

arms and ammunition using two African allies in preparation for next year\\'s crucial presidential election, it has been established. Financial Gazette investigations in the past one-and-a-half months have revealed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Namibia are helping Zimbabwe circumvent an international arms embargo to buy huge quantities of guns and bullets for next year\\'s ballot. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The arms embargo was imposed on Harare last year by Europe and the United States on President Robert Mugabe\\'s government because of its appalling human rights record. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The investigations show that Zimbabwe is importing and massing an assortment of guns at army bases around the country in preparation for the poll, which is expected to be violent. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Most of the guns have been arriving secretly at Suri Suri airbase in Chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The bulk of the weapons have arrived from the DRC in that country\\'s military cargo plane. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The weapons consist of a significant portion of French-made guns, most of which top government sources say will be distributed to war veterans who are central to the ruling ZANU PF party\\'s re-election strategy in the presidential poll. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The sources say Zimbabwe, after the massive depletion of its armoury because of its participation in the three-year-old DRC war, has been finding it extremely difficult to replenish its arms stocks because its traditional and cheaper arms suppliers in Europe are refusing to sell it arms. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This had forced the army to implement some unpalatable measures, including the grounding of most of its entire fleet of Hawk fighter aircraft due to Britain\\'s refusal to sell spare parts. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Virtually all European Union member states have severed ties with Zimbabwe and imposed an arms embargo on the country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Although we can still buy a number of arms from countries like Russia and China, a greater part of our fairly priced weapons, ammunition and spares have been sourced from mainly European countries like Britain, Sweden, France and others over the years. We can no longer buy arms from Europe at the moment because of the problems here,\" said a top Ministry of Defence source. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We have been left with no alternative but to buy some weapons via our allies in the DRC who have access to some of these European weapons that we have preference for.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi declined to comment on the allegations of sanctions busting and the massing of guns at army bases around the country. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Just avoid that one for now. I am not going to comment on that one,\" Sekeramayi said yesterday before immediately cutting off his telephone. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Asked why weapons of French origin were finding their way into Zimbabwe in an interview last month, Jerome Sautier, the first counsellor at the French embassy in Harare, and Lieutenant Colonel Dault, the defence attache, said France was not selling any arms to Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two said they had no knowledge of the arrival of French arms in the country but said France sold arms to several African countries which could in turn re-sell them to other countries. They said they did not know whether this was the case with Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"In Africa, we have military relationships with many countries. We have, for instance, sold arms to many French-speaking countries. These arms can in turn be re-sold by those other countries,\" said Sautier, adding that there was also the possibility of illegal arms trafficking outside the authority of the French government. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The first secretary at the Namibian High Commission in Harare, Mati Jose, said he had no knowledge of Namibia helping Zimbabwe to bust the arms embargo while the DRC\\'s ambassador to Zimbabwe Mawapanga Mwanananga could not be reached for comment. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Authoritative military sources said the army will be training and arming war veterans to ensure that Mugabe is re-elected in the ballot which must be held by the end of March. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A number of bases have been established for the war veterans throughout Zimbabwe, particularly in those areas which did not have army camps. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The sources said the war veterans will operate from these bases, their main objective being to make it impossible for the MDC to campaign in rural areas. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Opposition supporters would also be harassed and ejected out of the rural areas to disable them from voting in their constituencies. A number of war veterans have in fact already been armed. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said in a statement that ZANU PF supporters who smashed MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai\\'s vehicle and thwarted his planned meeting with his party\\'s structures in Sanyati last week were armed with guns. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A senior government official said: \"I sympathize with those who want change in the presidential elections but judging by the groundwork that ZANU PF is doing to deal with the opposition, I am afraid to say that I don\\'t see that change coming.\"\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20010718/23.47.18-27024": {"extract": [{"text": "According to military experts, it is possible that clashes will resume between the Taleban and UIFSA forces in various regions of Afghanistan in the next few days and weeks.", "question": "clashes will resume between the Taleban and UIFSA forces", "answer": ["w", "military experts"]}], "context": "\\t\\nTaleban commanders have prepared themselves for new offensives on positions of the United Islamic Front [for the Salvation] of Afghanistan in some regions of Afghanistan. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to reports from Afghan sources, high-ranking Taleban commanders, including [Interior Minister] Mola Abdorrazaq Akhond and Mola Abdol Qahir [phonetic], visited the front line in [northeastern] Takhar Province yesterday morning, Tuesday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Over the last few days, the Taleban dispatched a number of their troops from [the capital of northern Balkh Province] Mazar-e Sharif under the command of Qayum and Hashim to Takhar.

Bush"]}], "context": "\\t\\nTOKYO, Feb 18 (AFP) -- US President George W. Bush said Monday that all options were on the table to deal with Iraq, Iran and North Korea, even as Germany warned against any \"adventure\" in Iraq. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n At the start of his Asian tour, Bush dismissed a chilly reception by US allies to his \"axis of evil\" rhetoric, telling reporters in Tokyo, \"I will keep all options on the table. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We want to resolve all issues peacefully, whether it be Iraq, Iran or North Korea,\" Bush said, speaking next to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Bush has lumped those three countries together in what terms an \"axis of evil,\" in language that has riled US allies. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The president renewed his pledge to thwart terrorist groups who want to \"mate up\" with regimes hoping to acquire weapons of mass destruction and said \"nations will come with us\" if the US-led war on terrorism is extended. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"People who love freedom understand that we cannot allow nations that aren\\'t transparent, nations with a terrible history, nations that are so dictatorial they\\'re willing to starve their people, we can\\'t allow them to mate up with terrorist organizations,\" Bush said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Asked about French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine\\'s criticism of the \"axis\" concept as \"simplistic,\" Bush said: \"I understand what happens in the international arena; people say things. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"But the leaders I\\'ve talked to understand, exactly, what needs to happen. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"They understand that our commitment is not just in Afghanistan, that history has given us a unique opportunity to defend freedom,\" he added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Bush, who arrived in Tokyo Sunday at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Seoul and Beijing, held talks with Koizumi on the war effort in Afghanistan. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But the leaders did not \"specifically\" talk about military action against any other country, a senior US administration official said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Bush is due to travel to Seoul Tuesday and the following day will visit the heavily fortified no-man\\'s land between South Korea and communist North Korea. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The United States maintains some 37,000 troops on the Korean peninsula, and Bush has called the de-militarised zone dividing South Korea from its hardline communist northern neighbour \"one of the most dangerous places on earth\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But his tough stand on P\\'yongyang has provoked concern in Seoul, where President Kim Tae-chung, who is in the last year of his five-year term, has been trying to prise the hermit state out of isolation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n South Korean ministers fear Bush\\'s tough talking may put back by years Kim\\'s so-called Sunshine Policy of establishing a permanent peace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Angry anti-US protests erupted in Seoul ahead of Bush\\'s arrival with police storming the American Chamber of Commerce and detaining 32 students occupying the building. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n During the three-hour occupation, protesters hurled leaflets proclaiming Bush to be a \"war freak\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n US diplomats say Bush will seek to support Kim\\'s Nobel Prize winning policy by offering new talks with the North, while remaining firm about North Korea\\'s missile sales and its feared chemical and biological weapons programmes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n North Korea remains unconvinced, calling Bush the head of \"an empire of evil.\" Its state media said last week that Bush \"is the most bellicose and heinous\" US president, and added his visit was only intended to \"fan up war hysteria\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Even though US officials have stressed that no firm military plans exist for expanding the war on terror launched after the September 11 attacks, they said late Sunday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should go. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We\\'ve made no secret of the fact that we think that the world will be much safer when the Iraqi people have a regime that they deserve instead of the regime that they have,\" National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told CBS television. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Washington has long accused Baghdad, under UN sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, of developing weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But Baghdad insisted Sunday it could not be a threat to the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"It is the United States that is threatening Iraq and not the contrary. They are the ones attacking Iraq, not the other way round,\" said Ath-Thawra, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party in Baghdad. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Even if Iraq possessed such weapons, it could not threaten the United States. How could it threaten a country that possesses weapons of mass destruction that could destroy entire planets?\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In Berlin, Germany\\'s chief government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye told journalists, \"The federal government cannot imagine that the United States government has an interest in engaging in an adventure\" in Iraq. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pledged \"undivided support\" for the fight against terrorism a week after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, saying, \"Germany is ready for risks, including military ones, but not for adventures.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He had also insisted on the right of the allies to be informed and consulted about US plans. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The German government spokesman said it would be \"useful\" if UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer last week sharply criticised Bush\\'s \"axis of evil\" remarks, telling a newspaper that such a concept \"gets us nowhere.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Iran, which has long had tense relations with its western neighbor, voiced opposition to a new US strike against Iraq. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We hope that the issue would be solved through peaceful means, with initiatives from the UN secretary general and a more active role by the UN,\" Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi told a news conference. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We also hope that Iraq gives a favourable response and allows UN weapon inspectors\" to return to the country, he added. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Kharazi said that some 150 foreigners arrested recently on Iran\\'s border with Pakistan were not members of the al-Qaeda terror network, but admitted some could be sympathisers and would be sent back to their home countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Among those being held were 40 women, between 70 and 80 children and a number of men of European, North African and Middle East origin, including a handful of Afghans. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A diplomatic source said the affair could become \"embarrassing\" for European countries, \"because of the insistence of the Americans on judging for themselves\" those who supported al-Qaeda. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al-Qa\\'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran, which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would act if provided with evidence. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In another verbal attack Kharazi accused the United States of wanting to exercise \"world dictatorship\" since the \"horrible attacks\" of September 11. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"America\\'s rulers have proved that they cannot be trusted,\" he said. \"They are seeking unilaterally to become the masters of the world and want to sweep aside all competitors from other countries.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Afghan interim Interior Minister Yunus Qanooni told AFP that two suspects in last week\\'s murder of aviation and tourism minister Abdul Rahman had been arrested in Saudi Arabia and could be sent back to Afghanistan. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020220/20.57.00-17276": {"extract": [{"text": "State Minister Resat Dogru and his wife Mualla Dogru and Kyrgyz
