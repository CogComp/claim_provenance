started on Monday, with the participation of officials from several Arab banks, discussing the impact and size of this problem in the Middle East. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n During the workshop, organised by the Union of Arab Banks (UAB), participants will also review legislation Arab countries have introduced to combat this phenomenon as well as the ways and means by which money is laundered. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Participants will also explore the role of banking and financial institutions in combating money laundering and the American and European approaches to fighting this problem. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to UAB Secretary General Fu\\'ad Shakir the size of money laundering worldwide ranges from 2 to 5 per cent of the world\\'s gross domestic product, which could run up to $1.5 trillion. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said that banks, real estate, construction projects, stock markets, investing in losing companies and gambling are among the favourite targets for money launderers. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The source of this money includes drug trafficking, arms deals and prostitution which are the major sources of what has been termed as \"dirty money.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The process of money laundering starts with what has been termed as Placement, or injecting the dirty money into the market, followed by Layering, or removing all traces of the money laundered and finally Integration, where the money becomes \"clean\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Although interest in this issue started in the 1980\\'s, world attention on money laundering intensified following the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington, Shakir,

\"Our institutions are far away from this money laundering phenomenon and Arab governments have amended banking laws to combat money laundering,\" Shakir said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Jordan was among the Arab countries which introduced measures to fight this problem including tightening banking rules and imposing strict controls on money transfers. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Punishment for money laundering was also introduced, illegal money is confiscated and tough jail terms are given to violators. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Money launderers target countries with low risk of detection, soft tax systems and lenient banking regulations, Shakir said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said, according to international agencies which combat this phenomenon, statistically the United States ranks first in term of destination, origin and flows of laundered money. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In Europe, Italy and Russia top the list while China ranks first among Asian countries. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to Shakir, money laundering in the Arab

According to Malan, another approach is necessary in this period of transition of the Argentine crisis. He suggests the definition of a series of priorities. \"The priority now is to unshackle the credit system, for there is no modern economy that can function without credit. Credit needs banks, a functioning payment system. This priority is urgent right now,\" he told participants in the seminar on \"The Euro and Brazil,\" organized by this newspaper. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Malan criticizes the stance taken by multilateral institutions like the IMF, who are asking for reforms in Argentina before the country can receive financial help. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy\\'s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the Finance Minister says. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Pedro Malan\\'s attitude in relation to Argentina is very different from that of Jaime Caruana, governor of the Bank of Spain, the Spanish central bank. To Caruana, Argentina has to \"create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Spain is one of the leading investors in Argentina, whose instability had a big impact on the results of Spanish banks in 2001. But Caruana said that the banks \"did their homework\" and made provisions for their investments in Argentina. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to Argentina, a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country, recounting their experiences in situations like the one the Argentines are facing. In the group were former Bank of Mexico Governor Miguel Mancera, who dealt with the peso crisis in 1995; a former Chilean Central Bank president who faced the 1982 crisis, when the Chilean GDP dropped by 14 percent; former IMF Fiscal Affairs Director Vito Tanzi; an expert in restructuring the Spanish debt; and former Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola, who lived through the time of the Collor government\\'s withholdings and of the Proer [Program to Encourage the Reorganization and Strengthening of the National Financial System] - the program to restructure the Brazilian banking system. In Argentina\\'s defense, Malan says that Brazil\\'s Mercosur partner \"has sought to define with clarity the fundamental issues of its basic regimes - foreign exchange (floating exchange rate regime), monetary (they intend, after phase of transition, to define their inflation goal system, which was important to Spain from 1995-1998) and fiscal.\" This, the Minister insists, is why \"it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks,\" referring to what the IMF and some governments, like that of the United States, are asking. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Malan defends a single currency for Mercosur. \"We want to keep alight the flame of a single currency in the region in future, even if a distant one,\" but until then, \"there is the job of consolidating the institutions in the political and institutional sphere, of productive restructuring and of modernizing the State\" in six countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy. \"We do not want to yield on Brazil\\'s having its own currency, its regional currency. Dollarization is a not very trivial process of negotiation with the country that issues the currency, in this case the dollar, involving complex questions about the role of ultimate lender, the role of the Federal Reserve in the supervision and regulation of the banks in the dollarized country.\" According to Malan, the dollarization process is irreversible. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina, resulting from the floating of the real in 1999, will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system. Malan predicts that Argentina will be more competitive when it emerges from the crisis. \"A little calm is needed, the ability to look ahead, not let oneself be carried by the difficulties of the moment,\" he emphasizes. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to the Minister, Mercosur managed, after an \"enormous technical effort,\\' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, Bolivia and Chile, which were not comparable before. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Today we have comparable statistics; there is a macroeconomic monitoring group in the Finance Ministry and experts from the six countries\\' central banks who meet regularly. Based on this effort of statistical harmonization, we announced, in December 2000, an agreement for basic convergence parameters. The presidents of the six countries endorsed certain goals in relation to the debt, GDP, nominal deficits as a proportion of the six countries\\' GDPs, and maximum inflation. Whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the European Union\\'s experience,\" the Minister says. According to Malan, \"long marches start with first steps.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This was an important step that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called a little Maastricht, that is, the search for convergence parameters that serve as a reference point for talks between experts from the six countries, the Minister says. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n To Malan, however, more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense - structural, macro and microeconomic ones. The Finance Minister says he hopes, for Mercosur, something similar to what happened in the EU: \"an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down, like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting, that see the difficulties as being insurmountable, and the problems as being unsolvable.\" Malan defends a different posture: \"to set aside the notion of cynicism, skepticism, that things will not work out,\" and believe, like the Europeans, that there is a future to be built by the Mercosur countries and Chile and Bolivia, the associate members. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Minister says that after the October elections in Brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011225/20.43.49-8525": {"extract": [{"text": "When asked by journalists whether Indonesia had any plans to halt repayment on its US$70 billion national debt, Dorodjatun said: \"No.\"", "question": "to halt repayment on its US$70 billion national debt", "answer": ["w", "journalists", "Indonesia"]}, {"text": "He declined to comment further but said the country would continue to honor its commitment with the International Monetary Fund, which is coordinating some $5 billion in aid to help the country overcome its current economic crisis in return for reforms.", "question": "to comment further", "answer": ["w", "Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti"]}], "context": "\\t\\nJAKARTA (Agency): Indonesia will not follow Argentina and halt payment of its national debt, top economics minister Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti said as quoted by AFP on Monday [24 December]. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n When asked by journalists whether Indonesia had any plans to halt repayment on its US$70 billion national debt, Dorodjatun said: \"No.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He declined to comment further but said the country would continue to honor its commitment with the International Monetary Fund, which is coordinating some $5 billion in aid to help the country overcome its current economic crisis in return for reforms. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Indonesia\\'s foreign debt currently stands at $140 billion, $70 billion of which is government debt. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On Sunday, Argentina declared it was halting payments on its $132 billion national debt, the biggest default in history.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020211/20.26.52-10078": {"extract": [{"text": "It is expected to lay a foundation for further bilateral cooperation projects in this field as well as seeking funding for future projects.", "question": "It", "answer": ["w"]}], "context": "\\t\\nHanoi, Feb. 9 (VNA) -- Vietnam and the United States will organize a scientific conference on human health and the environmental effects of Agent Orange/Dioxins in Hanoi's Daewoo Hotel from Mar. 3-6. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to the National Institute of Environment and Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the US, the conference will offer scientists worldwide opportunities to exchange scientific information on the effects of Agent Orange/Dioxins on human health and the environment and discuss measures to reduce the hazards of this toxic chemical.

minority. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his inauguration speech shortly after he was sworn in as president, Mugabe vowed to continue with his government\\'s controversial land reform program. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He told thousands of cheering supporters that \"land reforms must proceed with greater speed and strength\" to shore up the economy, badly battered by years of political instability. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of Zimbabwe\\'s arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy, and we will do that through the land reforms,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In the run-up to the March 9-11 poll, critics had accused the Zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country\\'s closest-fought election since independence in 1980. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But he told the nation that in spite of stiff opposition to the agrarian reforms from powerful Western countries, especially the country\\'s former colonial power of Britain, he would press ahead to seize farms from whites and resettle blacks. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"That message has not been accepted in Britain, that Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans. This is our land, and we have no intention of owning a piece of land in Britain,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n He described his victory in the poll as \"a stunning blow to imperialism\" and thanked African countries for supporting Zimbabwe in its stand-off with Western countries over the agrarian reforms. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Many African leaders have supported Mugabe\\'s re-election victory in Zimbabwe\\'s crucial election, which they said was \" transparent, credible, free and fair\". \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Mugabe said Zimbabwe needed their continued support against what he called hostile international attention. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"When they aim at Zimbabwe, it is not Zimbabwe alone, they have other countries in mind.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his campaign for re-election, the Zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused Britain and its Western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in Zimbabwe, and the region, by installing a compliant opposition party in power. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Thanks to the people, our people and the people of Africa for this joint effort in rejecting this neocolonial attempt. Africa is for Africans,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n However, Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n South African President Thabo Mbeki and President Olusegun Obasanjo are expected in Harare Monday for talks with the Zimbabwean leader on a possible government of national unity. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two, along with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, are members of a Commonwealth panel charged with assessing the election and recommending possible action by the group against Zimbabwe. The panel was scheduled to meet in London on Tuesday. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow Britain and the United States to save face over their insistence on the MDC\\' s victory in Zimbabwe\\'s election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The European Union (EU) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A final communique issued on Saturday evening after the Barcelona EU summit said, \"The European Union will maintain its humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe and will consider possible additional targeted measures against its government.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Sunday\\'s inauguration ceremony was boycotted by EU countries, the US and some members of the Commonwealth. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Also, the opposition\\'s 57 members of parliament stayed away. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n In his inaugural address, Mugabe extended an olive branch to the opposition to join him in rebuilding the country\\'s economy, which has suffered three years of consecutive decline, but did not say in what role. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"Our energy is better spent on reviving the economy than plotting to bring down each other,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The call to all of us, whether in the ruling party or in the opposition, is that we unite and come together as one people. There are areas where we must work together because we have a common destiny,\" said Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The MDC party rejected the voting results, claiming the government rigged the poll in favor of incumbent President Mugabe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n MDC leader Tsvangirai said pre-election violence prevented his party from campaigning in rural areas, the stronghold of the ruling party, and that thousands of his supporters in towns were disenfranchised when they failed to vote because authorities reduced polling centers in urban areas. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The ZANU-PF government denied rigging the election, saying Mugabe won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU-PF\\'s land policy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Analysts said Mugabe received much of his votes from the rural areas, where voter turnout was considered much higher than in towns and cities. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011127/21.22.54-17837": {"extract": [{"text": "Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the
