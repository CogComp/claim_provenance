After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference, it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants, who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry. But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries; rather, the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group.  The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America]. American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security.", "hypothesis": "the majority of the participants claims The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference", "label": 0, "completed": true}], [{"id": 1174, "premise": "In July, the Bush administration decided to let the \"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\" \"freeze\" in the Senate.
