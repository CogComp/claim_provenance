Barring any reversal to the trend, the weekly quoted U.S. magazine Business Weekly as saying that Beijing might bring the island to its knees without firing one bullet.   Another factor which might deter Beijing's military adventurism in the Taiwan Strait is Washington's \"readiness to fight Beijing for Taiwan,\" which will bear witness to Washington's determination to remain a power in Asia, according to the magazine.   The publication quoted Wu Guoguang, a professor at Hong Kong University, as saying that any concessions by Washington on the Taiwan issue could trigger a defection of its Asian allies, including Japan, to Beijing's fold.  But Beijing's leaders are not likely to blink on the issue either because an independent state in Taiwan would boost the schisms in Tibet and Xinjiang and threaten the regime in Beijing, the magazine claimed.
