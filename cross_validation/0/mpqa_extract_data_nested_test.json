the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert. The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech, Morocco at the start of the month. If the protocol, which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases, is put into effect, the nation\\'s export will be heavily damaged. The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union (EU) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990\\'s. The government and business circle expect the nation\\'s exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008, when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol. The reason is that South Korea\\'s industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol. Also, advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier. Moreover, the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen. South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers, and Korea\\'s per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries. Under this situation, the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations. In particular, Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States\\' ratification of the protocol. The U.S. backed out of the agreement, saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore. Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018, there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then. If things go on like this, the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment-friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing. The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency. According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol\\'s requirements. \"The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption,\" an industry source said.

The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, on the start of his visit to Austria, protested against this dictatorial move by the United States. He also condemned the statement made by President Bush terming Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and that these countries are preparing weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Apparently President Bush's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche. This can be traced back to the events in 1818, when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks. Since then, the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living. The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n According to the analysis of Chomsky, after World War II, the US think tank had planned to subjugate a few regions of the world for its economic progress. The Middle East and many countries of the Third World were part of the plan. During the same period, anti-Soviet hysteria was also promoted strongly. The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice. As a result, the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963, Dominican Republic in 1984, Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950, that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost. It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic, was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it. It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is due to this hegemony, which the United States wants to maintain, that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world. The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment. After the 11 September events, the United States completely ignored the international convention of human rights and by doing so negated its own constitution. After the events in Washington and New York, approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail, and one person, Mohammed Butt, died of heart failure during detention. No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves. Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba. These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there. As a lesson to others!\\n, various American TV channels, daily, show shots of the conditions under which these prisoners are being kept. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Above all, the US media has reported that the involvement of Jews in the 11 September events cannot be ruled out. The media also reported that 120 Israeli spies were arrested and were exiled from the United States on the orders of the Department of Justice. This not only shows the double standards of the US but also its selfishness. This also exposes the background of keeping the US troops and military basis in different parts of the world. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Therefore, China is justified in demanding that the United States, by creating conflicts and by embarking upon the policy of oppression and supremacy should stop interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights. According to China, the American society is engulfed by violence and crime. Racial prejudice has assumed alarming proportions. There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n This report [above-mentioned document by China] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective. Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard. The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001--the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States.

Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran. Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington\\'s biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic. The UN rapporteur\\'s new report on Iran, which he submitted to the commission on Friday, includes nothing new. In most cases he described the legal punishments like floggings and executions of murderers and major drug traffickers that are applied based on the Shria, or Islamic law as human rights violations. In other cases, he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities. He made such charges despite the fact that women\\'s political, social and cultural participation is not less than that of men. Women in Iran hold managerial, academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet. And as far as minorities are concerned, they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority, as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely. In his report, the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran\\'s internal affairs. For instance, he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran, while the measure has been taken in line with the law. He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations! This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials. Interestingly, although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996, he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic. This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime. Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}}
