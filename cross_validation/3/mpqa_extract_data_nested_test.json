Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said. Missing passports find their way to human traffickers, he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"About 90 percent of foreigners\\' missing passports are Korean\\'s, and the missing passports are being used mostly for crimes like illegal entry, downgrading the nation\\'s credibility in the international community,\" the official said. The number of crimes committed by Koreans has also been on the increase. Among the crimes are illegal trafficking or forgery of passports, drug production and transportation, smuggling, overstaying visas and drunk driving, the official said. Last year, 1.6 million Koreans travelled to China, up from 1.34 million in 2000, and the number of Korean students in China hit 16,000, more than any other country; Japan trailed with 15,000 students,

They have pointed out: When will a \"coup\" not be called a \"coup\"? It will not be a \"coup\" so long as the United States thinks it is not! According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms. This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days. When questioned by a reporter \"why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America,\" Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator \"may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch.\" \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It turns out that in the dictionary used by the United States, the definition of a \"democratic regime\" is subjected to double standards. In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" that the US always likes to dwell on. Other than that, nothing will count. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Attachments: JFJB 29 apr 2002.pdf\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20020212/20.59.39-4666": {"extract": [{"text": "But Daschle also saw the three countries as threats to the United States, saying that Bush was \"right in calling attention to the danger they pose to the United States.\"", "question": "they", "answer": ["w", "US Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle", "President George W.

kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The memory Russia\\'s Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of. Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth\\'s atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia. Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth. Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia\\'s national sovereignty. At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO). [passage omitted on technical details of operation of GSO] \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota. But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator. Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia\\'s objections. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n International law governing accountability if one nation\\'s space debris falls on another is already in existence. The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth\\'s atmosphere. The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states\\' space projects. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14. This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one\\'s hands. Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention. This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory. Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle. This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim. It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim. In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station. This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia\\'s few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion. Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said. It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities. If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator. This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases,\" Priyatna said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter. In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications. This is a very important lesson for Indonesia. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]. \"In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn\\'t go against the current. Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit,\" he said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour\\'s space activities. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n \"The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities. The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes,\" Priyatna said. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour. \"Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre. Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967. Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn\\'t it be better to join them in our own national interest?\" he asked. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception. These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind. But the problem is, who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20010914/22.24.21-23558": {"extract": [{"text": "But for the world, September 11 is a day that will mark the entire world,\" Noble said.", "question": "September 11", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble"]}, {"text": "The 1998 warrant charged that Bin-Ladin, a Saudi billionaire housed as a \"guest\" in Afghanistan, was involved in the 1994 murder of two Germans in Syrte, Libya.", "question": "Bin-Ladin", "answer": ["w", "The 1998 warrant"]}, {"text": "\"There are moments in every nation\\'s history which are marked forever.", "question": "moments in every nation's history", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble"]}, {"text": "The force, based in Lyon, France, will work non-stop to \"help to filter any information coming from Interpol country members,\" Noble said.", "question": "help to filter any information coming from Interpol country members", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble"]}, {"text": "\"He may walk with a cane,\" the study says, noting that he speaks Arabic and \"Southwest Asian countries and the Middle East are the places where he may travel around.\"", "question": "He", "answer": ["w", "The other warrant"]}, {"text": "US authorities have asked Interpol to organize a police team specialized in identifying victims, they said, refusing to comment further on the status of Interpol\\'s collaboration, saying, \"We do not want to do anything which could undermine FBI investigations.\"", "question": "Interpol to organize a police team specialized in identifying victims", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble", "the US Government"]}, {"text": "The study also notes that the United States offered five million dollars (5.4 million euros) to anyone who had information that could lead to Bin-Ladin's arrest.", "question": "information that could lead to Bin-Ladin's arrest", "answer": ["w", "The other warrant", "the US Government"]}, {"text": "\"There are moments in every nation\\'s history which are marked forever.", "question": "moments in every nation's history which are marked forever", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble"]}, {"text": "\"There are moments in every nation\\'s history which are marked forever.", "question": "moments in every nation's history which are marked forever", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble"]}, {"text": "Interpol will meet in Budapest from September 24-29, where member countries will discuss methods of bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice, Espigares and Noble said.", "question": "those responsible for the attacks", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble", "member countries"]}, {"text": "\"He may walk with a cane,\" the study says, noting that he speaks Arabic and \"Southwest Asian countries and the Middle East are the places where he may travel around.\"", "question": "he", "answer": ["w", "The other warrant"]}, {"text": "The other warrant, from April 4, 2000, was drafted at the request of the US Government and includes a detailed description of the man who tops the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) most wanted list.", "question": "The other warrant", "answer": ["w", "the US Government"]}, {"text": "The file said that Libya had demanded his extradition.", "question": "his extradition", "answer": ["w", "The 1998 warrant", "Libya"]}, {"text": "US authorities have asked Interpol to organize a police team specialized in identifying victims, they said, refusing to comment further on the status of Interpol\\'s collaboration, saying, \"We do not want to do anything which could undermine FBI investigations.\"", "question": "comment further on the status of Interpol's collaboration", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble"]}, {"text": "US authorities have asked Interpol to organize a police team specialized in identifying victims, they said, refusing to comment further on the status of Interpol\\'s collaboration, saying, \"We do not want to do anything which could undermine FBI investigations.\"", "question": "do anything which could undermine FBI investigations", "answer": ["w", "Espigares and Noble", "Espigares and Noble"]}], "context": "\\t\\nMADRID, Sept 14 (AFP) -- Interpol on Friday released previously confidential search warrants with vital details about the life and activities of Usamah bin-Ladin, the main suspect in Tuesday\\'s deadly attacks in the United States. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The two warrants -- from 1998 and 2000 -- were released at a press conference here by Interpol President Jesus Espigares of Spain and Secretary General Ronald K.

Britain\\'s Prime Minister, Tony Blair, privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent \"retreat\" by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today\\'s meeting in London by the troika of Australia, Nigeria and South Africa. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But how could Blair have \"a Commonwealth report\" when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members, asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the \"Blair report\" had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe. Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Blair\\'s second faux pas in Australia, according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders, came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe\\'s Foreign Minister, Dr Stan Mudenge. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Nigerian leader, President Olusegun Obasanjo, had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain\\'s negative position regarding Zimbabwe, but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Zimbabwean minister did this. Then Mudenge rose to his feet, strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The hand symbolised reconciliation; and Blair accepted it. Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser, Britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders: How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported \"Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe\" when they had not? \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Meanwhile, back in Harare, some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government-owned Sheraton Hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n There, unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper The Herald is distributed to guests, the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Furthermore, as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify, many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme. Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n During the 2000 parliamentary elections, 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Instead, an Australian member of the Federal Parliament, Julie Bishop, vented her anger towards the President and Government, and the electoral process, in Australia\\'s media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions. Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers? Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of \"consensus\", she and others of a similar view were dismissed as \"troublemakers\" by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday\\'s inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country\\'s decision to condemn Zimbabwe\\'s presidential election. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n And close by, Howard will have the British government and the western media. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n And, in line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n No doubt Blair will fight on. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa, not with the people of Britain and Europe.\\t\\n\\n\\n"}, "20011008/21.49.24-6596": {"extract": [{"text": "But, Koizumi has not changed his plan to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site of the 1937 clash that led to an eight-year war

2 -- Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah today accused Pakistan army for breeding terrorism in India to remain in power against the wishes of their people who want peace. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n 'For their sustenance and survival, Pak generals have been throttling the voice of Pakistanis who wish to live in friendship and cordiality with their neighbours', the Chief Minister said while addressing a function organised by United Public High School at Channi Himat here this afternoon. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n The Chief Minister described Pakistan as mother of terrorism and said if the world has to rid itself from this menace, the perpetrators across the border had to be dealt with firmly. He said mere positioning of army at borders was not enough as infiltration was still continuing. The ultras were indulging in blood-shed and their lunaticism has touched such heights that they were not even sparing the worship places, he said and referred to the attack in Raghunath bazaar and temple complex. He cautioned the people against the enemy and said that extra vigil will certainly help in nabbing suspects. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Reiterating that Pakistan will not give up terror, the Chief Minister said that ultimately the demon they have reared will eat up their own vitals. 'Those digging graves for others, get engraved themselves', he said while citing the example of Afghanistan. He said Pakistan is attempting hard to put India in communal flames so that forces are withdrawn from the borders to deal with the internal situations, thereby leaving field day for ultras to cross over to this side. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Dr Abdullah also dwelt on the spread of education saying that teaching younger generation means steering the nation to prosperity and progress. 'Concentrate on those today who are the builders of nation tomorrow', he asked the teachers community while appreciating the involvement of parents in career building of their wards. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Responding to the demands put forth in a memorandum by the residents of Chhanni Himmat, Narwal, Malik Marker Bye-Pass, Chhanni Bija, Chhanni Rama, Chhanni Kamala and Ambedkar Nagar, the Chief Minister said that he will get examined the issue regarding addition of 11th and 12th classes in the area. He called for launching a coaching class for various competitive exams, as the area has no such facility. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Dr Abdullah also dwelt on various social services in the area and said that answer to meeting the growing demand of tap water in various localities of Jammu is tapping of Chenab water for the purpose. In this regard, he said, a Rs 400 crore scheme had been prepared a few years back that is currently under process for implementation. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Expressing concern over dwindling moral values in the society, the Chief Minister said that youngsters must get inspiration from their glorious past and respect their parents and teachers. He said due regard to elders and teachers is imperative for harmonious society. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Dr. Abdullah presented best teacher award and appreciated the performance of student artists who presented cultural items. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Minister for Sports and Labour, Mr. Harbans Singh was the chief guest. He also spoke on the occasion. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n Among others present were, Mr. Mohammed Syed Akhoon and Mrs Bimla Luthra, MLAs [Ministers of Legislative Assembly] besides students and parents.
