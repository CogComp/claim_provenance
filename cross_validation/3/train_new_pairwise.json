Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others.But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life.", "hypothesis": "he claims to sacrifice himself for the CDU in an election that once looked impossible to win", "label": 0, "finished": true}], [{"id": 1448, "premise": "Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic.
